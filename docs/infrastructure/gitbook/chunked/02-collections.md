# Collections

Organize your spaces into folders.

Collections are a way to group spaces together to make it easier for you to organize your content. With collections, you can:

* organize your content by similar topics or ideas
* manage space [permissions](https://gitbook.com/docs/documentation/account-management/member-management/permissions-and-inheritance) at scale by allowing you to override the organization-level defaults.

### Create a collection

Click the **+** button next to the **Spaces** header in the sidebar to create a new collection. You can also create a collection or space within another collection from the collection’s main page.

### Move a collection

You can move a collection by opening the **Actions menu** <picture><source srcset="https://1050631731-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FNkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X%2Fuploads%2FQ4IsWwmEEi5QM7PSXNsN%2Factions%20-%20dark.svg?alt=media&#x26;token=ebff54f4-9825-4ab0-99bc-633e1c449371" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://1050631731-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FNkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X%2Fuploads%2F89MTSo5XRpPMVr1T0rxS%2Factions.svg?alt=media&#x26;token=2b5d001e-560a-4f29-8d22-de8163725ca1" alt="The Actions menu icon in GitBook"></picture>, selecting **Move collection to…** and choosing a destination. Alternatively, you can drag and drop collections in the sidebar to move or reorder them.\
\
You can move collections into other collections — or even to other organizations, if you have an [admin role](https://gitbook.com/docs/documentation/account-management/member-management/roles) in both.

### Nested collections

You can nest collections inside each other, creating a collection -> sub-collection -> space hierarchy.

Open a collection and you can click **New collection** from the collection’s main page to create a sub-collection.

To move one collection into another, click **Move collection to…** from the collection’s **Action menu** <picture><source srcset="https://1050631731-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FNkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X%2Fuploads%2FQ4IsWwmEEi5QM7PSXNsN%2Factions%20-%20dark.svg?alt=media&#x26;token=ebff54f4-9825-4ab0-99bc-633e1c449371" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://1050631731-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FNkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X%2Fuploads%2F89MTSo5XRpPMVr1T0rxS%2Factions.svg?alt=media&#x26;token=2b5d001e-560a-4f29-8d22-de8163725ca1" alt="The Actions menu icon in GitBook"></picture> and then choose its new location. Alternatively, you can drag and drop the collection to its new location.

### How to delete a collection

You can delete a collection by opening its **Actions menu** <picture><source srcset="https://1050631731-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FNkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X%2Fuploads%2FQ4IsWwmEEi5QM7PSXNsN%2Factions%20-%20dark.svg?alt=media&#x26;token=ebff54f4-9825-4ab0-99bc-633e1c449371" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://1050631731-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FNkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X%2Fuploads%2F89MTSo5XRpPMVr1T0rxS%2Factions.svg?alt=media&#x26;token=2b5d001e-560a-4f29-8d22-de8163725ca1" alt="The Actions menu icon in GitBook"></picture> and selecting **Delete**.

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Deleting a collection is final**, but spaces inside a deleted collection will move to the **Trash** and can be restored up to seven days after deletion. You can access the Trash from the bottom of the sidebar.
{% endhint %}



# Blocks

Add and edit blocks within your content.

GitBook is a block-based editor, meaning you can add different kinds of blocks to your content — from standard text and images to interactive blocks. Your pages can include any combination of blocks you want, and there’s no limit to the number of blocks you can have on a page.

<figure><img src="https://1050631731-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FNkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X%2Fuploads%2FMznFq7FlIn7aPdPMpiY5%2Fcreating-content-blocks.svg?alt=media&#x26;token=1cbf2ed0-893f-4f95-b963-3dc2943354a6" alt="A GitBook screenshot showing the available content blocks"><figcaption><p>GitBook's built in content blocks.</p></figcaption></figure>

### Inserting a new content block

You can insert a new content block below an existing block using your mouse:

1. Hover over the block above the place you need the new content block.
2. Click on the `+` icon that appears on the left to open the insert palette.
3. Select the block you want from the drop-down menu to insert it.

Alternatively, on a new line, you can press `/` to launch the insert palette, which lists all the available blocks. You can scroll through the list to find the one you want, or use your keyboard to search for the block you want, navigate up and down the list, and insert it with `Enter`.

### Exiting a block

Some content blocks capture the editing cursor to allow you to add content in the context of that block. For example, when you’re writing in [a hint block](https://gitbook.com/docs/documentation/creating-content/blocks/hint), hitting `Enter` will add a new line within the hint block, rather than a new paragraph below.

When you are done, you can continue adding new content to the page either by inserting a new block using the `+` button to the left of your content, or by hitting **⌘ + Enter** on a Mac or **Ctrl + Enter** on a PC.

### Selecting blocks and interacting with selected blocks

You can select a single block by pressing the `Esc` key with the cursor in the block. You can also select multiple blocks by highlighting content within them and hitting `Esc`.

Once selected, you can:

* Select more blocks by clicking on them while keeping the **Shift ⇧** key pressed.
* Moving up and down to select the block above or below, using the **↑** and **↓** keys
* Copy the entire block using **⌘ + C** (Mac) or **Ctrl + C** (Windows)
* Cut the entire block using **⌘ + X** (Mac) or **Ctrl + X** (Windows)
* Delete the selected block or blocks using **⌫** or **Del**.

### Full-width blocks

By making your blocks full width, you can create a clear visual hierarchy in your content, or simply give more space to content that needs it.

To make a block full width, click on the **Options menu** <picture><source srcset="https://1050631731-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FNkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X%2Fuploads%2FjYRg42UtM4u1pHmJl4Ln%2Fdrag%20-%20dark.svg?alt=media&#x26;token=4c219b2b-37d2-449e-9130-19b6ba3d38d2" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://1050631731-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FNkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X%2Fuploads%2FaS1QvPIBVYwhpFTGcPBN%2Foptions-menu.svg?alt=media&#x26;token=3ee40bbf-f4fb-41fa-aa30-306b559cbe88" alt="The Options menu icon in GitBook"></picture> next to your block and select **Full width**. This feature is available for the following block types:

* Code Blocks
* Image blocks
* Tables
* Cards
* API Blocks
* Integration blocks
* Columns



# Paragraphs

Add a paragraph block to insert formatted text, inline images and more

A paragraph is the most basic content block you can use on GitBook.

{% hint style="info" %}
You can [add other inline content](https://gitbook.com/docs/documentation/creating-content/formatting/inline) to your paragraph, such as emojis, images and Math & TeX.

You can also [format your text](https://gitbook.com/docs/documentation/creating-content/formatting) using the context menu or keyboard shortcuts, or using [Markdown](https://gitbook.com/docs/documentation/creating-content/formatting/markdown).
{% endhint %}

### Example of a paragraph

Professionally printed material in English typically does not indent the first paragraph, but indents those that follow. For example, Robert Bringhurst states that we should “set opening paragraphs flush left.”

### Representation in Markdown

Because a paragraph block is just text, that’s how it’s represented in Markdown.

{% code overflow="wrap" %}

```markdown
Professionally printed material in English typically does not indent the first paragraph, but indents those that follow. For example, Robert Bringhurst states that we should “set opening paragraphs flush left.”
```

{% endcode %}



# Headings

Add heading blocks to a page to organize your content and improve SEO

Headings help give your documents structure — and using keywords in headings will also help search engines understand that structure, which can help your page rank higher in search results.

GitBook offers three levels of headings. Heading levels 1 (H1) and 2 (H2) will appear in the [page outline](https://gitbook.com/docs/documentation/resources/gitbook-ui#page-outline).

### Anchor links

When you add a heading to a page, it creates an anchor link. You can then link directly to these specific sections, to point people to relevant information.

#### Link to an anchor

You can see anchor links in public content, or private content in read-only mode, by hovering over the title and clicking the `#` that appears next to it. This will update the URL in your browser’s top bar, so you can copy it to use elsewhere.

If you want to link to a particular anchor from a page within your GitBook space, you can use a [relative link](https://gitbook.com/docs/documentation/formatting/inline#relative-links), which will update if you change the heading to prevent the link from breaking.

#### Edit an anchor

By default, the anchor link will be identical to the text in your header. If you plan to link to that URL outside of GitBook, changing the header in future will break the anchor link. The link will then take visitors to the top of the page, rather than the anchor location.

To avoid this, you can manually set the anchor link by opening the **Options menu** <picture><source srcset="https://1050631731-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FNkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X%2Fuploads%2FjYRg42UtM4u1pHmJl4Ln%2Fdrag%20-%20dark.svg?alt=media&#x26;token=4c219b2b-37d2-449e-9130-19b6ba3d38d2" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://1050631731-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FNkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X%2Fuploads%2FaS1QvPIBVYwhpFTGcPBN%2Foptions-menu.svg?alt=media&#x26;token=3ee40bbf-f4fb-41fa-aa30-306b559cbe88" alt="The Options menu icon in GitBook"></picture> for the header, then choosing **Edit anchor**. You can then enter the anchor link you wish to use — this will remain the anchor even if you change the header itself.

### Representation in Markdown

GitBook generates SEO optimized pages, meaning page titles in GitBook are automatically represented in markdown as a first level heading:

```markdown

# I'm a page title
```

This means that if you [sync your content with Git](https://gitbook.com/docs/documentation/getting-started/git-sync), page headers added through the editor will be represented as one level lower:

{% code overflow="wrap" %}

```markdown

## My heading 1
### My heading 2
#### My heading 3
```

{% endcode %}

### Heading examples <a href="#example-of-a-heading" id="example-of-a-heading"></a>


## My heading 1

### My heading 2

#### My heading 3



# Unordered lists

Add an unordered list block to create bullet point lists

Unordered lists are great for making a series of points that do not necessarily need to be made in a particular order. They are effectively bullet point lists, with support for nesting as needed.

When typing a list in GitBook, you can exit the list and start a new empty block below by hitting  `Enter` twice.

### Example of unordered list

* Item
  * Nested item
    * Another nested item
  * Yet another nested item
* Another item
* Yet another item

{% hint style="info" %}
To create nested items, you can use **Tab** to indent and **⇧ + Tab** to outdent.
{% endhint %}

### Representation in Markdown

```markdown
- Item
   - Nested item
      - Another nested item
   - Yet another nested item
- Another item
- Yet another item
```



# Ordered lists

Add an ordered or numbered list to a page

Ordered lists, also called numbered lists, help you prioritize items or create a list of steps.&#x20;

### Example of ordered list

1. Item 1
   1. Nested item 1.1
      1. Nested item 1.1.1
   2. Nested item 1.2
2. Item 2
3. Item 3

{% hint style="info" %}
To create nested items, you can use **Tab** to indent and **⇧ + Tab** to outdent.
{% endhint %}

### Representation in Markdown

```markdown
1. Item 1
   1. Nested item 1.1
      1. Nested item 1.1.1
   2. Nested item 1.2
2. Item 2
3. Item 3
```

### Adding an inline image to an ordered list

Adding images inside of ordered lists is possible in GitBook

If you want to add an image within an ordered list, add it using the insert menu, then on the row below the image type `3.` then hit `Space`, and the ordered list will continue.

1. Item 1
2. Item 2

![](https://1050631731-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FNkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X%2Fuploads%2FFduOhhJv1OXwe96Dhu7L%2F14_03_25_site_sections_published.jpg?alt=media\&token=a4e6f422-0e0f-4e3c-a676-c71fd8e4da7a)

3. Item 3
4. Item 4



# Task lists

Add a task list to display tasks that can be completed

Task lists allow you to create a list of items with checkboxes that you can check or uncheck.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** Readers of your published space will not be able to check or uncheck these boxes. You can decide which boxes are checked and unchecked when you create the content.
{% endhint %}

### Example of a task list

* [ ] Here’s a task that hasn’t been done
  * [x] Here’s a subtask that has been done, indented using `Tab`.
  * [ ] Here’s a subtask that hasn’t been done.
* [ ] Finally, an item, unindented using `shift` + `tab`.

### Representation in markdown

```markdown
- [ ] Here’s a task that hasn’t been done
  - [x] Here’s a subtask that has been done, indented using `tab`
  - [ ] Here’s a subtask that hasn’t been done.
- [ ] Finally, an item, unidented using `shift` + `tab`.
```



# Hints

Add a hint to a page to draw your reader’s attention to specific pieces of important information.

Hints, or callouts, are a great way to bring the reader’s attention to specific elements in your documentation, such as tips, warnings, and other important information.&#x20;

There are four different hint styles — you can change the style by clicking the colored icon, or by opening the block’s **Options menu** <picture><source srcset="https://1050631731-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FNkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X%2Fuploads%2FjYRg42UtM4u1pHmJl4Ln%2Fdrag%20-%20dark.svg?alt=media&#x26;token=4c219b2b-37d2-449e-9130-19b6ba3d38d2" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://1050631731-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FNkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X%2Fuploads%2FaS1QvPIBVYwhpFTGcPBN%2Foptions-menu.svg?alt=media&#x26;token=3ee40bbf-f4fb-41fa-aa30-306b559cbe88" alt="The Options menu icon in GitBook"></picture> and selecting the style you want.

Hint blocks support [inline content](https://gitbook.com/docs/documentation/creating-content/formatting/inline) and [formatting](https://gitbook.com/docs/documentation/creating-content/formatting), as well some specific block types. To see which block types you can use in a hint, hit `/` on an empty line and check the [insert palette](https://gitbook.com/docs/documentation/creating-content/blocks/..#inserting-a-new-content-block).

### Examples of hint blocks <a href="#example-of-a-hint" id="example-of-a-hint"></a>

{% hint style="info" %}
**Info hints** are great for showing general information, or providing tips and tricks.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
**Success hints** are good for showing positive actions or achievements.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Warning hints** are good for showing important information or non-critical warnings.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Danger hints** are good for highlighting destructive actions or raising attention to critical information.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}

#### This is a H2 heading

This is a line

This is an inline <img src="https://1050631731-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FNkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X%2Fuploads%2F0FzoF68PAY3Rv297meNB%2Fcommand.svg?alt=media&#x26;token=b07ff261-6e28-4879-8ab1-039a49f6ab41" alt="The Apple computer command icon" data-size="line"> image

* This is a second <mark style="color:orange;background-color:purple;">line using an unordered list and color</mark>
  {% endhint %}

To add a heading to your hint, you need to create a heading block as the the first block in the hint.

### Representation in Markdown

```markdown
{% hint style="info" %}
**Info hints** are great for showing general information, or providing tips and tricks.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
**Success hints** are good for showing positive actions or achievements.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Warning hints** are good for showing important information or non-critical warnings.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Danger hints** are good for highlighting destructive actions or raising attention to critical information.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}

{% endhint %}
```



# Quotes

Add a quote block to a page to highlight copy you’re adding from elsewhere, or to draw attention to a specific part of your text

Quotes are useful when you want to include something from another source.

Start a quote by typing `>` followed by pressing `Space` in an empty paragraph, or use the[ insert palette](https://gitbook.com/docs/documentation/creating-content/blocks/..#inserting-a-new-content-block). You can also convert a paragraph block to a quote by highlighting the entire paragraph and hitting `>`.

### Example of a quote

> "No human ever steps in the same river twice, for it’s not the same river and they are not the same human." — *Heraclitus*

### Representation in Markdown

{% code overflow="wrap" %}

```markdown
> "No human ever steps in the same river twice, for it’s not the same river and they are not the same human." — _Heraclitus_
```

{% endcode %}



# Code blocks

Add a code block to a page to include sample code, configurations, code snippets and more

You can add code to your GitBook pages using code blocks.

When you add a code block, you can choose to [set the syntax](#set-syntax...), [show line numbers](#with-line-numbers), [show a caption](#with-caption), and [wrap the lines](#wrap-code). It’s also easy to [copy the contents of a code block to the clipboard](#copying-the-code), so you can use it elsewhere

A code block may be useful for:

* Sharing configurations
* Adding code snippets
* Sharing code files
* Showing usage examples of command line utilities
* Showing how to call API endpoints
* And much more!

### Example of a code block

{% code title="index.js" overflow="wrap" lineNumbers="true" %}

```javascript
‌import * as React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import App from './App';

ReactDOM.render(<App />, window.document.getElementById('root'));
```

{% endcode %}

You can also combine code blocks with a [tabs block](https://gitbook.com/docs/documentation/creating-content/blocks/tabs) to offer the same code example in multiple different languages:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="JavaScript" %}

```javascript
let greeting = function (name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
};
greeting("Anna");
```

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Ruby" %}

```ruby
greeting = lambda {|name| puts "Hello, #{name}!"}
greeting.("Anna")
```

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Elixir" %}

```elixir
greeting = fn name -> IO.puts("Hello, #{name}!") end
greeting.("Anna")
```

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

{% hint style="info" %}
You can make code blocks [span the full width of your window](https://gitbook.com/docs/documentation/creating-content/blocks/..#full-width-blocks) by clicking on the **Options menu** <picture><source srcset="https://1050631731-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FNkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X%2Fuploads%2FjYRg42UtM4u1pHmJl4Ln%2Fdrag%20-%20dark.svg?alt=media&#x26;token=4c219b2b-37d2-449e-9130-19b6ba3d38d2" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://1050631731-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FNkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X%2Fuploads%2FaS1QvPIBVYwhpFTGcPBN%2Foptions-menu.svg?alt=media&#x26;token=3ee40bbf-f4fb-41fa-aa30-306b559cbe88" alt="The Options menu icon in GitBook"></picture> next to the block and choosing **Full width**.
{% endhint %}

### Code block options <a href="#options" id="options"></a>

When you click on the **Options menu** <picture><source srcset="https://1050631731-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FNkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X%2Fuploads%2FjYRg42UtM4u1pHmJl4Ln%2Fdrag%20-%20dark.svg?alt=media&#x26;token=4c219b2b-37d2-449e-9130-19b6ba3d38d2" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://1050631731-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FNkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X%2Fuploads%2FaS1QvPIBVYwhpFTGcPBN%2Foptions-menu.svg?alt=media&#x26;token=3ee40bbf-f4fb-41fa-aa30-306b559cbe88" alt="The Options menu icon in GitBook"></picture> next to the code block, or the **Actions menu** <picture><source srcset="https://1050631731-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FNkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X%2Fuploads%2FQ4IsWwmEEi5QM7PSXNsN%2Factions%20-%20dark.svg?alt=media&#x26;token=ebff54f4-9825-4ab0-99bc-633e1c449371" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://1050631731-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FNkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X%2Fuploads%2F89MTSo5XRpPMVr1T0rxS%2Factions.svg?alt=media&#x26;token=2b5d001e-560a-4f29-8d22-de8163725ca1" alt="The Actions menu icon in GitBook"></picture> in the block itself, you’ll see a number of options you can set.

#### Set syntax… <a href="#set-syntax" id="set-syntax"></a>

You can set the syntax in your code block to any of the supported languages. This will enable syntax highlighting in that language, too.

{% hint style="info" %}
We use [Prism](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism) for syntax highlighting. You can use [Test Drive Prism](https://prismjs.com/test.html#language=markup) to check which languages Prism supports. If you notice a mismatch between GitBook and Prism, there’s a chance we’re a version or two behind. We’ll catch up soon!
{% endhint %}

{% code title="filename.txt" %}

```
// Some code
```

{% endcode %}

#### With line numbers <a href="#with-line-numbers" id="with-line-numbers"></a>

This will toggle line numbers for your code on and off.

Showing line numbers is useful when the code represents the contents of a file as a whole, or when you have long code blocks with lots of lines. Hiding line numbers is useful for snippets, usage instructions for command line or terminal expressions and similar scenarios.

#### With caption

This will toggle a caption that sits at the top of the block, above your lines of code.

The caption is often the name of a file as shown in [our example above](#example-of-a-code-block), but you can also use it as a title, description, or anything else you’d like.

#### Wrap code

This will toggle code wrapping on and off, so long lines of code will wrap to all be visible on the page at once.

Wrapping lines is useful when your code is long and you want to avoid having the viewer scroll back and forth to read it. If you toggle **Wrap code** on, you may also want to show line numbers — this will make it easier to read the code and understand where new lines start.

#### Expandable

This will toggle showing the code in full (when the toggle is off) or a collapsed window of the code which the user can expand (when the toggle is on).

The collapsed view defaults to showing 10 lines of code with an button to expand to show the full code block. If there are less than 10 lines of code, all the content will be shown.

### Code block actions

As well as the options above, you can also change the language the code block displays, and copy your code instantly.

#### Copy the code <a href="#copying-the-code" id="copying-the-code"></a>

# Files

Manage and add files to your space such as PDFs, videos, documents and more

You can upload files to your GitBook space and add them to your page for people to view or download.

You can show some files, such as images and OpenAPI files, on the page itself for people to see without clicking anything. For others, such as PDFs, users will have to click to view or download it.

You can also optionally add a caption below any file you insert into your page to add more information if needed.

### Example of a file <a href="#example-of-a-file" id="example-of-a-file"></a>

{% file src="<https://1050631731-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FNkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X%2Fuploads%2Fgit-blob-9ff1c1eef1d9ee1744295e274d3ee01fae848a20%2Fexample.pdf?alt=media>" %}
This is a caption on a file.
{% endfile %}

### Uploading a file

You can manage uploaded files in the Files side panel of your space. You can find the Files panel at the top of your space’s table of contents.

To upload a file, drag and drop it into the **Drop your file or browse** section, or select it and use your system file dialog to select the file you want to upload.

{% hint style="warning" %}
GitBook allows you to upload files up to 100MB per file.
{% endhint %}

You can also add files to your space when you add an [image block](https://gitbook.com/docs/documentation/creating-content/blocks/insert-images) or an [OpenAPI block](https://gitbook.com/docs/documentation/api-references/openapi). When you create one of these blocks, the Files panel will open, so you can either select a file, or upload a new file.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Tip:** You can also drag and drop images from your file system directly into the editor — or paste a copied image into your content. GitBook will automatically add them to the Files side panel for the respective space, so you can view and manage them later.
{% endhint %}

### Renaming a file

To rename a file, open the **Actions menu** <picture><source srcset="https://1050631731-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FNkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X%2Fuploads%2FQ4IsWwmEEi5QM7PSXNsN%2Factions%20-%20dark.svg?alt=media&#x26;token=ebff54f4-9825-4ab0-99bc-633e1c449371" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://1050631731-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FNkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X%2Fuploads%2F89MTSo5XRpPMVr1T0rxS%2Factions.svg?alt=media&#x26;token=2b5d001e-560a-4f29-8d22-de8163725ca1" alt="The Actions menu icon in GitBook"></picture> for the file, and click **Edit**. In the dialog prompt, enter the new name of your file.

### Deleting a file

To delete a file, open the **Actions menu** <picture><source srcset="https://1050631731-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FNkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X%2Fuploads%2FQ4IsWwmEEi5QM7PSXNsN%2Factions%20-%20dark.svg?alt=media&#x26;token=ebff54f4-9825-4ab0-99bc-633e1c449371" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://1050631731-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FNkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X%2Fuploads%2F89MTSo5XRpPMVr1T0rxS%2Factions.svg?alt=media&#x26;token=2b5d001e-560a-4f29-8d22-de8163725ca1" alt="The Actions menu icon in GitBook"></picture> for the file and click **Delete**. After confirming in the dialog that you’re sure you want to delete the file, your file will be deleted.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Note:** Make sure you update any pages that included your deleted file! File blocks that reference a deleted file will show an empty block, or *Could not load image* error.
{% endhint %}

### Replacing a file

If you have a file that simply needs updating to a new version, you can replace it. This will swap out the old file and put the new file in its place. Any blocks that previously referred to the old file will then refer to the new file.

To replace a file, open the **Actions menu** <picture><source srcset="https://1050631731-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FNkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X%2Fuploads%2FQ4IsWwmEEi5QM7PSXNsN%2Factions%20-%20dark.svg?alt=media&#x26;token=ebff54f4-9825-4ab0-99bc-633e1c449371" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://1050631731-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FNkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X%2Fuploads%2F89MTSo5XRpPMVr1T0rxS%2Factions.svg?alt=media&#x26;token=2b5d001e-560a-4f29-8d22-de8163725ca1" alt="The Actions menu icon in GitBook"></picture> for the file and click **Replace**. In the file replacement dialog that appears, select the new file and wait for the upload indicator to complete. Your file will automatically update everywhere it appeared in your space.

This can be helpful if, for example, you’ve had a major product redesign and need to update outdated UI screenshots that appear on multiple pages. Replacing the original file would update the screenshot everywhere in your space, saving you time and effort.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Tip:** Once you’ve uploaded an image or a file, you can reference it anywhere in your space by creating an image or a file block and selecting it from the **Files** side panel.

We recommend you do this rather than uploading the image again every time you want to include it, to make it easier to replace images later and to avoid having multiple files with the same name.
{% endhint %}

### Representation in Markdown

```markdown
{% file src="https://example.com/example.pdf" %}
    This is a caption for the example file.
{% endfile %}
```



# Images

Add an image or a gallery of images to a page, add image variants for dark mode, and resize and align images to your needs

You can insert images into your page, then choose their size and whether to align them to the left, center, or right. You can also optionally include alt text and/or a caption on your image block.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Tip:** For accessibility purposes, we recommend setting alt text for your images.
{% endhint %}

### Example of an image block <a href="#example-of-an-image-block" id="example-of-an-image-block"></a>

<div align="center"><figure><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1446776709462-d6b525c57bd3?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=srgb&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=M3wxOTcwMjR8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHwyfHxzcGFjZXxlbnwwfHx8fDE3MzMxOTY5NTR8MA&#x26;ixlib=rb-4.0.3&#x26;q=85" alt="A photograph taken from space looking back towards Earth. A satellite is in the foreground, and in the background is an ocean-covered part of our planet with patchy clouds."><figcaption><p>Example of an image block with a caption</p></figcaption></figure></div>

### Uploading an image

There are two ways to add images to your content:

1. Drag and drop the image from your file management system directly into an empty block on your page.
2. [Add an image block](https://gitbook.com/docs/documentation/creating-content/blocks/..#inserting-a-new-content-block) to your page and use the **Select images** side panel that appears on the right of the window.

If you follow the second process, you can choose to upload a file, select a previously-uploaded file, paste an image URL or add an image from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) using the built-in search.

{% hint style="warning" %}
GitBook allows you to upload images up to 100MB per file.
{% endhint %}

#### Create an image gallery

Adding more than one image to an image block will create a gallery. To do this, open the block’s **Options menu** <picture><source srcset="https://1050631731-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FNkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X%2Fuploads%2FjYRg42UtM4u1pHmJl4Ln%2Fdrag%20-%20dark.svg?alt=media&#x26;token=4c219b2b-37d2-449e-9130-19b6ba3d38d2" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://1050631731-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FNkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X%2Fuploads%2FaS1QvPIBVYwhpFTGcPBN%2Foptions-menu.svg?alt=media&#x26;token=3ee40bbf-f4fb-41fa-aa30-306b559cbe88" alt="The Options menu icon in GitBook"></picture> and choose **Add images…** to open the **Select images** side panel again.

To delete an image from a gallery, open the **Edit menu** <picture><source srcset="https://1050631731-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FNkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X%2Fuploads%2F8pD8Y2BfBxCEZoi99Pnk%2Fedit%20-%20dark.svg?alt=media&#x26;token=89496678-7347-4845-8c98-ee8dd9bedaec" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://1050631731-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FNkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X%2Fuploads%2FA3OfGjPkE5GnOQvN36jN%2Fedit.svg?alt=media&#x26;token=6f70239f-d889-4e64-9ec6-4801df47a48d" alt=""></picture> on the image you want to delete and press the **Delete ⌫** key.

### Adding images for light & dark mode <a href="#light-and-dark-mode" id="light-and-dark-mode"></a>

You can set different images for the light and dark mode versions of your published site. GitBook will automatically display the correct image depending on the mode your visitor is in.

To add an image for dark mode, hover over your image, open the **Edit menu** <picture><source srcset="https://1050631731-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FNkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X%2Fuploads%2F8pD8Y2BfBxCEZoi99Pnk%2Fedit%20-%20dark.svg?alt=media&#x26;token=89496678-7347-4845-8c98-ee8dd9bedaec" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://1050631731-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FNkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X%2Fuploads%2FA3OfGjPkE5GnOQvN36jN%2Fedit.svg?alt=media&#x26;token=6f70239f-d889-4e64-9ec6-4801df47a48d" alt=""></picture> and click **Replace image** <picture><source srcset="https://1050631731-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FNkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X%2Fuploads%2FOZynA3CTv4FUC3nb2fB0%2Freplace%20image%20-%20dark.svg?alt=media&#x26;token=4ca7ecae-68ef-4ccf-b8dc-fd1f09425f4f" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://1050631731-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FNkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X%2Fuploads%2F0mPo1tPDFeEbPOr1gc4V%2Freplace%20image.svg?alt=media&#x26;token=9f037f9a-0f37-4c5b-9b30-6b55ffb11f5b" alt="The Replace image icon in GitBook"></picture>.

In the drop-down menu, choose **Add image for Dark mode**. Once you’ve set this, you can replace either image from this same menu.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Note:** GitBook doesn’t currently support light and dark mode images for certain cases, including page covers or image covers on [cards](https://gitbook.com/docs/documentation/creating-content/blocks/cards).
{% endhint %}

### Light and dark mode images through GitHub/GitLab Sync <a href="#light-and-dark-mode-through-github-gitlab-sync" id="light-and-dark-mode-through-github-gitlab-sync"></a>

You can also add light and dark mode images in Markdown through HTML syntax (`<picture>` and `<source>`).

For block images, use the `<figure>` HTML element with a `<picture>` and `<source>` in it:

```html
Text before

<figure>
  <picture>
    <source
      srcset="
        https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3369400/139447912-e0f43f33-6d9f-45f8-be46-2df5bbc91289.png
      "
      media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"
    />
    <img
      src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3369400/139448065-39a229ba-4b06-434b-bc67-616e2ed80c8f.png"
      alt="GitHub logo"
    />
  </picture>
  <figcaption>Caption text</figcaption>
</figure>

Text after
```

For inline images (images that sit inline with text), use the `<picture>` HTML element with a `<source>` in it:

```html
Text before the image
<picture
  ><source
    srcset="
      https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3369400/139447912-e0f43f33-6d9f-45f8-be46-2df5bbc91289.png
    "
    media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" />
  <img
    src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3369400/139448065-39a229ba-4b06-434b-bc67-616e2ed80c8f.png"
    alt="The GitHub Logo"
/></picture>
and text after the image
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Note:** We don’t yet support [GitHub-only syntax](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-11-24-specify-theme-context-for-images-in-markdown/) through `#gh-dark-mode-only` or `#gh-light-mode-only`.
{% endhint %}

### Resizing

To resize your image, hover over it and open the **Edit menu** <picture><source srcset="https://1050631731-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FNkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X%2Fuploads%2F8pD8Y2BfBxCEZoi99Pnk%2Fedit%20-%20dark.svg?alt=media&#x26;token=89496678-7347-4845-8c98-ee8dd9bedaec" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://1050631731-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FNkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X%2Fuploads%2FA3OfGjPkE5GnOQvN36jN%2Fedit.svg?alt=media&#x26;token=6f70239f-d889-4e64-9ec6-4801df47a48d" alt=""></picture>. Click the **Size** button to change the size of your image from the available options.

<figure><img src="https://1050631731-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FNkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X%2Fuploads%2Fgit-blob-85f7b1f17894a13cae478727fdb8ffd1b37950e1%2F10_01_25_image_resizing.svg?alt=media" alt="A GitBook screenshot showing how to resize an image"><figcaption><p>Resize an image</p></figcaption></figure>

* **Small** – 25% of the image size
* **Medium** – 50% of the image size
* **Large** – 75% of the image size
* **Fit** – Removes all size specifications and displays either at full size or capped at a maximum width of **735** **pixels** for larger images.

If your image is wider than the editor, GitBook will limit the image’s width to the editor’s width instead, and resizing will be based on this limit.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** When resizing images in an image gallery, the results can differ from resizing an individual image.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
You can make image blocks [span the full width of your window](https://gitbook.com/docs/documentation/creating-content/blocks/..#full-width-blocks) by clicking on the **Options menu** <picture><source srcset="https://1050631731-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FNkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X%2Fuploads%2FjYRg42UtM4u1pHmJl4Ln%2Fdrag%20-%20dark.svg?alt=media&#x26;token=4c219b2b-37d2-449e-9130-19b6ba3d38d2" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://1050631731-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FNkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X%2Fuploads%2FaS1QvPIBVYwhpFTGcPBN%2Foptions-menu.svg?alt=media&#x26;token=3ee40bbf-f4fb-41fa-aa30-306b559cbe88" alt="The Options menu icon in GitBook"></picture> next to the block and choosing **Full width**.
{% endhint %}

### Resizing images through Git Sync

If you want more control over the sizing of your image, you can specify the exact size using Markdown in GitHub or GitLab.

When we export an image, we use the HTML tag `<img/>`. As per the specifications, we can specify the dimensions of the image using the `width` and `height` attributes, which only accept values in pixels or a combination of a number and a `%` sign.\
\
Valid variants for specifying the image dimensions are:\
\
`<img width="100" />` Sets the image to 100 pixels wide\
`<img width="100%" />` Sets the image to full size (although this will be limited by the editor)

### Aligning images

By default, image blocks will show your image at its full size, aligned centrally.

To change the alignment of an image, open the block’s **Options menu** <picture><source srcset="https://1050631731-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FNkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X%2Fuploads%2FjYRg42UtM4u1pHmJl4Ln%2Fdrag%20-%20dark.svg?alt=media&#x26;token=4c219b2b-37d2-449e-9130-19b6ba3d38d2" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://1050631731-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FNkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X%2Fuploads%2FaS1QvPIBVYwhpFTGcPBN%2Foptions-menu.svg?alt=media&#x26;token=3ee40bbf-f4fb-41fa-aa30-306b559cbe88" alt="The Options menu icon in GitBook"></picture> and choose the alignment you want. This will only affect images that are narrower than the editor, or images you’ve [resized](#resizing).

### Framing images

You can add a frame to image blocks to give your images a consistent look and visually separate them from their surrounding content.

<div data-with-frame="true"><figure><img src="https://1050631731-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FNkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X%2Fuploads%2FfL0VWcltHyuCKeqJsW0Q%2Fimage-frame-demo%402x.jpg?alt=media&#x26;token=6cac6c68-c288-4c42-abb2-e2bb7de23652" alt="A black and white photograph of a lone figure walking across a stark white landscape"><figcaption><p>Framed images can have captions, and show a subtle grid behind the caption.</p></figcaption></figure></div>

To add a frame to an image, hover over it, open the block’s **Options menu** <picture><source srcset="https://1050631731-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FNkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X%2Fuploads%2FjYRg42UtM4u1pHmJl4Ln%2Fdrag%20-%20dark.svg?alt=media&#x26;token=4c219b2b-37d2-449e-9130-19b6ba3d38d2" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://1050631731-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FNkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X%2Fuploads%2FaS1QvPIBVYwhpFTGcPBN%2Foptions-menu.svg?alt=media&#x26;token=3ee40bbf-f4fb-41fa-aa30-306b559cbe88" alt=""></picture> and enable the **With frame** toggle.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
**Good to know:** You can only frame single images in a block. Image blocks that contain multiple images and inline images cannot have frames.
{% endhint %}

# Embedded URLs

Embed videos, music and more directly into your page with a URL

To add an embedbed URL, simply paste the link of the content you want to embed and hit `Enter`.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** The content you want to embed must be publicly available in order for GitBook to access the file. For example, when embedding a Google doc the share settings must be set to *Anyone with the link*.
{% endhint %}

### Videos

{% embed url="<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_uLM5i0Z4c>" %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** You can choose to auto-play and loop YouTube and Vimeo embeds by adding `?autoplay=1&_loop=1` to the end of your video’s URL.
{% endhint %}

### Codepen

{% embed url="<https://codepen.io/davidkpiano/pen/wMqXea>" %}

### Spotify

{% embed url="<https://open.spotify.com/track/4FmiciU3ZmfgABlbCSXcWw?si=65zMAhStT2ivTit-kZISWg>" %}

### Representation in Markdown

```markdown
{% embed url="URL_HERE" %}
```



# Tables

Keep information organized and make documenting data easier with tables

You can add tables to better organize your information in a GitBook page.

<table data-full-width="false"><thead><tr><th>Company</th><th>Status<select><option value="36bef47f343d4588bc43db3e5c701796" label="In progress" color="blue"></option></select></th><th>Contact</th><th>MRR</th><th data-hidden>Contact</th><th data-hidden>MRR</th><th data-hidden>Status<select><option value="3e7a52c673ec4a01992566d18271f7a5" label="In progress" color="blue"></option><option value="2362fd3eafc7476fb8646ac754f34b72" label="Done" color="blue"></option></select></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Ace AI</strong> – Design</td><td><span data-option="36bef47f343d4588bc43db3e5c701796">In progress</span></td><td><a href="mailto:noreply@gitbook.com">rena@ace.ai</a></td><td>$450</td><td><a href="mailto:noreply@gitbook.com">rena@ace.ai</a></td><td>$420</td><td><span data-option="3e7a52c673ec4a01992566d18271f7a5">In progress</span></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Discrete Data</strong> – API</td><td></td><td><a href="mailto:noreply@gitbook.com">dave@dd.inc</a></td><td>$100</td><td><a href="mailto:noreply@gitbook.com">dave@dd.inc</a></td><td>$69</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>

### Table block options

When you open the Options menu to the left of a table block, you’ll have a number of options to change the appearance and manage the data inside the table:

* **Table/Cards:** Choose to display your data as either a table block or [a cards block](https://gitbook.com/docs/documentation/creating-content/blocks/cards). GitBook populates both these blocks using the same data, so you can switch between them depending on the look and design you want.
* **Add column:** Add a new column to the right of your table. You can choose column type using the menu, or just click **Add column** to add a text column.
* **Insert row:** Add a new row to the bottom of your table.
* **Show header:** Hide or show the top totle row of your table. Depending on the data you’re display, you may not need a title row in your table, so you can disable it here.
* **Reset column sizing:** If you’ve changed the column widths, this will reset them all to be equal again.
* **Visible columns:** Choose which columns are visible and which are hidden. If you have hidden columns in your table, this menu is where you can make them visible again.
* **Full width:** Make your table span the full width of your window. This is great for tables with lots of columns.
* **Delete:** Deletes the table block and all of it’s content.

### Changing a column type

Depending on the data you want to display, you can set table columns can have different data types. These add formatting, embellishments or restrictions to every cell in the column:

* **Text:** A standard text column, with standard formatting support.
* **Number:** A number column, with or without floating digits.
* **Checkbox:** A checkbox on each line that can be checked or unchecked.
* **Select:** You can select data from a list of options that you can define by opening the **Columns options** menu and choosing **Manage options**. This can be single-choice or multiple-choice.
* **Users:** You can add the name and avatar of a member of your organization. This can be single-choice or multiple-choice.
* **Files:** You can reference a file in the space. You can upload new files when populating cells in the column.
* **Rating:** A star rating. You can configure the maximum rating by opening the **Column options** menu and choosing **Max**.

Use the **Column options** menu to change a column’s type. When you change a column type, you’ll see a prompt asking you to confirm the change, as column data could be deleted or broken by this action.

### Resizing columns

Hover over a column’s edge and drag to resize it. A pixel count appears above the cursor to help you set consistent column sizes.

GitBook stores column sizes as a percentage of the overall width, which allows for relative sizing based on the overall width of the table.

### Scrolling tables

Tables that are wider than the editor container will be horizontally scrollable.

### Column options

To reorder columns, click and drag on the drag handle <picture><source srcset="https://1050631731-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FNkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X%2Fuploads%2Fpn5vEw7bYFrMPpdyvpSu%2Factions-horizontal%20-%20dark.svg?alt=media&#x26;token=ec39eefe-a391-4fe2-828a-082b79f2847d" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://1050631731-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FNkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X%2Fuploads%2FPnnI41SqLSaKBNwT98fW%2Factions-horizontal.svg?alt=media&#x26;token=99754200-a354-4ffe-931e-aa6322ea7395" alt="The table drag handle icon in GitBook"></picture> at the top of the column you want to move.

You can add new columns by clicking the **Add column** button that appears when you hover over the right edge of the table.

Inside the **Column options** menu you can also switch automatic sizing on and off, add a new column to the right, hide the column, or delete the column.

### Row options

Hover over the row and click the **Row options** <picture><source srcset="https://1050631731-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FNkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X%2Fuploads%2FQ4IsWwmEEi5QM7PSXNsN%2Factions%20-%20dark.svg?alt=media&#x26;token=ebff54f4-9825-4ab0-99bc-633e1c449371" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://1050631731-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FNkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X%2Fuploads%2F89MTSo5XRpPMVr1T0rxS%2Factions.svg?alt=media&#x26;token=2b5d001e-560a-4f29-8d22-de8163725ca1" alt="The Row options menu icon in GitBook"></picture> button that appears on the left of it to open the **Row options** menu. You’ll see a number of options:

* **Open row:** Open the row in a modal that shows all of its data. Here you can quickly change row types, edit data, and see data in hidden columns.
* **Insert above/below:** Add a new row above or below the currently-selected row.
* **Add column:** Add a new column on the right of the table.
* **Delete row:** Permanently remove all the data in the row from your table.

### Images in tables

When you click into a table cell, you can hit the / key to insert images. This will not work in the header row.

# Cards

Display information more dynamically with a set of cards — with or without images

You can use cards to create a visually pleasing page layout, combining text and images in a grid. They’re ideal for building landing pages or displaying any other content in a non-linear way.

You can adjust [switch between medium or large cards](#card-size) and link them to the relevant resources.

### Example of a card

<table data-view="cards"><thead><tr><th></th><th></th><th data-hidden data-card-target data-type="content-ref"></th><th data-hidden data-card-cover data-type="files"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>GitBook homepage</strong></td><td>Visit our website and find out more about GitBook.</td><td><a href="https://www.gitbook.com/">https://www.gitbook.com/</a></td><td><a href="https://1050631731-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FNkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X%2Fuploads%2FR8TYzdK3sBgPyHUAfLaf%2FGitBook%20homepage.svg?alt=media&#x26;token=75fb66e5-2e50-47d9-8d90-91938114caf9">card_gitbook_website.svg</a></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Developer docs</strong></td><td>Build you own GitBook integration!</td><td><a href="https://developer.gitbook.com/">https://developer.gitbook.com/</a></td><td><a href="https://1050631731-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FNkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X%2Fuploads%2FlMv6pwpKuVBb1iAgG8VE%2FDeveloper%20docs.svg?alt=media&#x26;token=7c7cab48-f429-4af0-afcd-a2db9c236067">card_developer_docs.svg</a></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Sign up to GitBook</strong></td><td>Click here to get started for free.</td><td><a href="https://app.gitbook.com/join">https://app.gitbook.com/join</a></td><td><a href="https://1050631731-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FNkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X%2Fuploads%2FqJfxhjqa71E4ZRf2qmig%2FSignup%20to%20GitBook.svg?alt=media&#x26;token=b0fd365e-cd5b-49d9-830d-f18ee793da7c">card_gitbook_signup.svg</a></td></tr></tbody></table>

### Adding links <a href="#adding-links-and-images-to-your-cards" id="adding-links-and-images-to-your-cards"></a>

Hover over a card and open its **Options menu** <picture><source srcset="https://1050631731-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FNkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X%2Fuploads%2FjYRg42UtM4u1pHmJl4Ln%2Fdrag%20-%20dark.svg?alt=media&#x26;token=4c219b2b-37d2-449e-9130-19b6ba3d38d2" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://1050631731-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FNkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X%2Fuploads%2FaS1QvPIBVYwhpFTGcPBN%2Foptions-menu.svg?alt=media&#x26;token=3ee40bbf-f4fb-41fa-aa30-306b559cbe88" alt="The Options menu icon in GitBook"></picture>. Here you can add a target link, so users can jump directly to a location when they click the card.

{% hint style="success" %}
When creating cards, we recommend you use **target links instead of hyperlinks**. With a target link, your readers can click anywhere on the card to access the linked URL.
{% endhint %}

### Adding images

Hover over a card and open its **Options menu** <picture><source srcset="https://1050631731-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FNkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X%2Fuploads%2FjYRg42UtM4u1pHmJl4Ln%2Fdrag%20-%20dark.svg?alt=media&#x26;token=4c219b2b-37d2-449e-9130-19b6ba3d38d2" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://1050631731-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FNkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X%2Fuploads%2FaS1QvPIBVYwhpFTGcPBN%2Foptions-menu.svg?alt=media&#x26;token=3ee40bbf-f4fb-41fa-aa30-306b559cbe88" alt="The Options menu icon in GitBook"></picture>. Here you can add a cover image to your card. Alternatively, just click the **Add cover image** option on the card itself.

This will open the **Select file** modal. Here you can drag and drop a new image into this, or use an image file you’ve previously uploaded to your space.

#### Adding images for dark mode

You can also add cover images that will only show in dark mode.

To do this, open the card’s **Options menu** <picture><source srcset="https://1050631731-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FNkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X%2Fuploads%2FjYRg42UtM4u1pHmJl4Ln%2Fdrag%20-%20dark.svg?alt=media&#x26;token=4c219b2b-37d2-449e-9130-19b6ba3d38d2" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://1050631731-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FNkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X%2Fuploads%2FaS1QvPIBVYwhpFTGcPBN%2Foptions-menu.svg?alt=media&#x26;token=3ee40bbf-f4fb-41fa-aa30-306b559cbe88" alt=""></picture> and choose **Cover** > **Edit cover** > **Add cover for dark mode**. This will open the **Select file** modal, where you can drag and drop a new image or select a previously-uploaded image.

#### Choosing the right image size

GitBook will automatically crop landscape images to a 16:9 ratio on desktop and mobile. If the images you upload are portrait or have a 1:1 ratio, they will be cropped to 16:9 on desktop and display as square or portrait on mobile.

<figure><img src="https://1050631731-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FNkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X%2Fuploads%2FNygg0LtXTalYWIWQCtOA%2F13_02_25_cards_desktop.svg?alt=media&#x26;token=7a485ddb-1a4a-40dd-95e8-cd03f65cbff2" alt="A GitBook screenshot showing card images on desktop"><figcaption><p>On desktop, all card images will display in a landscape 16:9 ratio, regardless of their dimensions. We recommend using the same dimensions for consistency.</p></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="https://1050631731-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FNkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X%2Fuploads%2Ft16RVp4AO8Ms8Qll6j1N%2F13_02_25_cards_mobile.svg?alt=media&#x26;token=5b34cf07-dbee-4f19-ab2d-d0126f502ecf" alt="A GitBook screenshot showing card images on mobile"><figcaption><p>On mobile, square or portrait images will displayed as shown on the left. Landscape images will be displayed as shown on the right.</p></figcaption></figure>

To keep things consistent across desktop and mobile, we recommend uploading all the images for your cards in a 16:9 format (e.g. 1920px x 1080px).

If you want your cards to adapt their layout depending on the screen size, we’d recommend uploading images with a 1:1 ratio, and the content of your image centered.

### Changing the size of cards

You can select the card size by opening the **Options menu** <picture><source srcset="https://1050631731-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FNkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X%2Fuploads%2FjYRg42UtM4u1pHmJl4Ln%2Fdrag%20-%20dark.svg?alt=media&#x26;token=4c219b2b-37d2-449e-9130-19b6ba3d38d2" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://1050631731-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FNkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X%2Fuploads%2FaS1QvPIBVYwhpFTGcPBN%2Foptions-menu.svg?alt=media&#x26;token=3ee40bbf-f4fb-41fa-aa30-306b559cbe88" alt="The Options menu icon in GitBook"></picture> to the left of your card block. The **Medium** option creates three cards in one horizontal line, while the **Large** option shows two larger cards on each line.

# Tabs

Add tabs so you can display large blocks of related information without creating a long, hard-to-navigate page

A tab block is a single block with the option to add multiple tabs.

Each tab can contain multiple other blocks, of any type. So you can add code blocks, images, integration blocks and more to individual tabs in the same tab block.

### Add or delete tabs

To add a new tab to a tab block, hover over the edge of a tab and click the `+` button that appears. To delete a tab, open the tab’s **Options menu** <picture><source srcset="https://1050631731-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FNkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X%2Fuploads%2FjYRg42UtM4u1pHmJl4Ln%2Fdrag%20-%20dark.svg?alt=media&#x26;token=4c219b2b-37d2-449e-9130-19b6ba3d38d2" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://1050631731-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FNkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X%2Fuploads%2FaS1QvPIBVYwhpFTGcPBN%2Foptions-menu.svg?alt=media&#x26;token=3ee40bbf-f4fb-41fa-aa30-306b559cbe88" alt="The Options menu icon in GitBook"></picture> then select **Delete**.

### Example

Here is an example that lists instructions relevant to specific platforms:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Windows" %}
Here are the instructions for Windows
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="macOS" %}
Here are the instructions for macOS
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Linux" %}
Here are the instructions for Linux
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

{% endtabs %}
```



# Expandable

Add an expandable block to a page to keep your pages shorter, hide longer content, or create FAQs

Expandable blocks are helpful in condensing what could otherwise be a lengthy paragraph. They are also great in step-by-step guides and FAQs.

### Example

<details>

<summary>Step 1: Start using expandable blocks</summary>

To add an expandable block hit `/` on an empty block, or click the `+` on the left of the editor, and select **Expandable**.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Step 2: Add content to your block</summary>

Once you’ve inserted an expandable block, you can add content to it — including lists and code blocks.

</details>


## Representation in Markdown

```markdown

# Expandable blocks

<details>

<summary>Expandable block</summary>



</details>
```

### Limitations

There are some limitations on which blocks you can create inside of an expandable block. You can check the full list by starting a new line in an expandable block and pressing `/` to bring up the insert palette.



# Stepper

Add a step-by-step guide to a page — perfect for guides, walkthroughs and technical troubleshooting processes

Stepper blocks let you break down a tutorial or guide into separate, but clearly linked steps. Each step can contain multiple different blocks, allowing you to add detailed information.

### Example

{% stepper %}
{% step %}

### Add a stepper block

To add a stepper block, hit `/` on an empty line or click the `+` on the left of the editor and select **Stepper** from the insert menu.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}

### Add some content

Once you’ve inserted your stepper block, you can start adding content to it — including code blocks, drawings, images and much more.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}

### Add more steps

Click the `+` below the step numbers or hit `Enter` twice to add another step to your stepper block. You can remove or change the style of the step header or step body if you wish.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}


## Representation in Markdown

<pre class="language-markdown"><code class="lang-markdown"><strong>## Example
</strong><strong>
</strong><strong>{% stepper %}
</strong>{% step %}
### Step 1 title
Step 1 text
{% endstep %}
{% step %}
### Step 2 title
Step 2 text
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}
</code></pre>

### Limitations

There are some limitations on which blocks you can create inside of a stepper block — for example, you cannot add expandable blocks or another stepper block. See all the blocks you can add by starting a new line within a stepper block and pressing `/` to bring up the insert palette.



# Drawings

Create drawings within GitBook and add them to your page

You can create a drawing or sketch directly though GitBook using the integrated [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) editor, then add it right into your GitBook page.

To create a drawing, press `/` on an empty line to bring up the insert palette and choose **Drawing**. This will open a popover with Excalidraw tools — simply close the popover when you’re done and your diagram will appear on your GitBook page.

GitBook stores drawings as special SVG files in the space. Those files have an extension of `drawing.svg`.

### Example of a drawing block

<img src="https://1050631731-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FNkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X%2Fuploads%2FEU4IQ0zVbLLZ2o7ivizA%2Ffile.excalidraw.svg?alt=media&#x26;token=789b9484-cf49-41d7-88ac-61bb1480e85f" alt="A diagram drawn in GitBook" class="gitbook-drawing">

### Draw with GitBook AI

{% hint style="info" %}
This feature is available on [Pro and Enterprise plans](https://www.gitbook.com/pricing).
{% endhint %}

When using drawing block, you can ask GitBook AI to generate an illustration by specifying a prompt. Simply type in a prompt and hit **Generate**, or choose one of the suggested prompts to get started.

Once GitBook AI has finished the drawing, you can double-click to open the full drawing palette and edit it however you like.

When editing a drawing, click the **Use AI to generate** button to bring up GitBook AI’s prompt editor again and generate a new drawing.

# Math & TeX

Add a mathTeX block to a page when you want to display a mathematical formula in your documentation

You can use the mathTeX format to include mathematical formulae in your documentation. We offer this through the [KaTeX](https://katex.org/docs/supported.html) library.

You can also add mathTeX [as inline content](https://gitbook.com/docs/documentation/formatting/inline#math-and-tex).&#x20;

### Example of Math & TeX block

$$
s = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N-1} \sum\_{i=1}^N (x\_i - \overline{x})^2}
$$

### Representation in Markdown

$$f(x) = x \* e^{2 pi i \xi x}$$

```markdown

# Math and TeX block

$$f(x) = x * e^{2 pi i \xi x}$$
```



# Page links

Add a page link block to show relations between pages in your space.

Page link blocks are the best way create relations between different pages within your content. Page links stand out on the page as they fill their own block — compared to a hyperlink added to some text.&#x20;

### Example of page link block

The links below point to [blocks](https://gitbook.com/docs/documentation/creating-content/blocks) and [inline content](https://gitbook.com/docs/documentation/creating-content/formatting/inline):

{% content-ref url="" %}
[](https://gitbook.com/docs/documentation/creating-content/blocks)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="../formatting/inline" %}
[inline](https://gitbook.com/docs/documentation/creating-content/formatting/inline)
{% endcontent-ref %}


## Representation in Markdown

```markdown
{% content-ref url="./" %} . {% endcontent-ref %}
```



# Columns

Add a column to create different layouts in your documentation.

Columns are a great way to create different layouts for your documentation. You can add many different types of blocks inside a column, and adjust the width of each side to customize it to the design you need.

{% columns %}
{% column width="50%" %}

### Create a seamless experience between your docs and product

Integrate your documentation right into your product experience, or give users a personalized experience that gives them what they need faster.

# Conditional content

Conditional content blocks let you control who can see a given block of content on your page based on user data and variables. These variables can be passed in via cookies, feature flags, authenticated access, or URL parameters.&#x20;

### Create conditional content

To add a conditional block, begin a new line in the editor, type <kbd>/</kbd>, then select  <picture><source srcset="https://1050631731-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FNkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X%2Fuploads%2FG1cXfAVYBRLW0aRpIDRJ%2Fpage-condition%20-%20dark.svg?alt=media&#x26;token=dd656a89-387d-41c7-adf8-994848ec3440" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://1050631731-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FNkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X%2Fuploads%2F51vQZhUqnkdsYpyUo1Pj%2Fpage-condition.svg?alt=media&#x26;token=31dd334a-5097-4081-915c-db460e610ec6" alt="The Page condition icon in GitBook"></picture> **Conditional content**.&#x20;

After inserting the block, click the red condition badge in the top right of the block.

Clicking this will allow you to add a condition through the [condition editor](https://gitbook.com/docs/documentation/publishing-documentation/adaptive-content/adapting-your-content#working-with-the-condition-editor). You’ll be able to write your condition as an [expression](https://gitbook.com/docs/creating-content/variables-and-expressions) that will run against data defined in your site. You can reference data from [variables](https://gitbook.com/docs/documentation/creating-content/variables-and-expressions), or data coming from visitors through their [claims](https://gitbook.com/docs/documentation/publishing-documentation/adaptive-content/enabling-adaptive-content#set-your-visitor-schema).

See [adaptive content](https://gitbook.com/docs/documentation/publishing-documentation/adaptive-content) for more details.

### Example

The examples below use a URL parameter linked from the button to control which conditional content block is visible.

{% if visitor.claims.unsigned.example\_attribute\_A %}
This block is only visible to users **with** attribute A.

<a href="https://gitbook.com/docs/creating-content/blocks/conditional-content?visitor.example_attribute_A=false" class="button primary">View without attribute A</a>
{% endif %}

{% if !visitor.claims.unsigned.example\_attribute\_A %}
This block is only visible to users **without** attribute A.

<a href="https://gitbook.com/docs/creating-content/blocks/conditional-content?visitor.example_attribute_A=true" class="button primary">View with attribute A</a>
{% endif %}
