## Execution


A **run** is an invocation of an assistant. Each run may have its own input, configuration, context, and metadata, which may affect execution and output of the underlying graph. A run can optionally be executed on a [thread](./persistence.md#threads).

The LangGraph Platform API provides several endpoints for creating and managing runs. See the [API reference](../cloud/reference/api/api_ref.html#tag/thread-runs/) for more details.
