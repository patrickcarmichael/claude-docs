## Create branches


Parallel execution of nodes is essential to speed up overall graph operation. LangGraph offers native support for parallel execution of nodes, which can significantly enhance the performance of graph-based workflows. This parallelization is achieved through fan-out and fan-in mechanisms, utilizing both standard edges and [conditional_edges](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/reference/graphs.md#langgraph.graph.MessageGraph.add_conditional_edges). Below are some examples showing how to add create branching dataflows that work for you.

### Run graph nodes in parallel

In this example, we fan out from `Node A` to `B and C` and then fan in to `D`. With our state, [we specify the reducer add operation](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/low_level.md#reducers). This will combine or accumulate values for the specific key in the State, rather than simply overwriting the existing value. For lists, this means concatenating the new list with the existing list. See the above section on [state reducers](#process-state-updates-with-reducers) for more detail on updating state with reducers.

```python
import operator
from typing import Annotated, Any
from typing_extensions import TypedDict
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END

class State(TypedDict):
    # The operator.add reducer fn makes this append-only
    aggregate: Annotated[list, operator.add]

def a(state: State):
    print(f'Adding "A" to {state["aggregate"]}')
    return {"aggregate": ["A"]}

def b(state: State):
    print(f'Adding "B" to {state["aggregate"]}')
    return {"aggregate": ["B"]}

def c(state: State):
    print(f'Adding "C" to {state["aggregate"]}')
    return {"aggregate": ["C"]}

def d(state: State):
    print(f'Adding "D" to {state["aggregate"]}')
    return {"aggregate": ["D"]}

builder = StateGraph(State)
builder.add_node(a)
builder.add_node(b)
builder.add_node(c)
builder.add_node(d)
builder.add_edge(START, "a")
builder.add_edge("a", "b")
builder.add_edge("a", "c")
builder.add_edge("b", "d")
builder.add_edge("c", "d")
builder.add_edge("d", END)
graph = builder.compile()
```

```python
from IPython.display import Image, display

display(Image(graph.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))
```

With the reducer, you can see that the values added in each node are accumulated.

```python
graph.invoke({"aggregate": []}, {"configurable": {"thread_id": "foo"}})
```

```
Adding "A" to []
Adding "B" to ['A']
Adding "C" to ['A']
Adding "D" to ['A', 'B', 'C']
```

!!! note

    In the above example, nodes `"b"` and `"c"` are executed concurrently in the same [superstep](../concepts/low_level.md#graphs). Because they are in the same step, node `"d"` executes after both `"b"` and `"c"` are finished.

    Importantly, updates from a parallel superstep may not be ordered consistently. If you need a consistent, predetermined ordering of updates from a parallel superstep, you should write the outputs to a separate field in the state together with a value with which to order them.

??? note "Exception handling?"

    LangGraph executes nodes within [supersteps](../concepts/low_level.md#graphs), meaning that while parallel branches are executed in parallel, the entire superstep is **transactional**. If any of these branches raises an exception, **none** of the updates are applied to the state (the entire superstep errors).

    Importantly, when using a [checkpointer](../concepts/persistence.md), results from successful nodes within a superstep are saved, and don't repeat when resumed.

    If you have error-prone (perhaps want to handle flakey API calls), LangGraph provides two ways to address this:

    1. You can write regular python code within your node to catch and handle exceptions.
    2. You can set a **[retry_policy](../reference/types.md#langgraph.types.RetryPolicy)** to direct the graph to retry nodes that raise certain types of exceptions. Only failing branches are retried, so you needn't worry about performing redundant work.

    Together, these let you perform parallel execution and fully control exception handling.

### Defer node execution

Deferring node execution is useful when you want to delay the execution of a node until all other pending tasks are completed. This is particularly relevant when branches have different lengths, which is common in workflows like map-reduce flows.

The above example showed how to fan-out and fan-in when each path was only one step. But what if one branch had more than one step? Let's add a node `"b_2"` in the `"b"` branch:

```python hl_lines="35"
import operator
from typing import Annotated, Any
from typing_extensions import TypedDict
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END

class State(TypedDict):
    # The operator.add reducer fn makes this append-only
    aggregate: Annotated[list, operator.add]

def a(state: State):
    print(f'Adding "A" to {state["aggregate"]}')
    return {"aggregate": ["A"]}

def b(state: State):
    print(f'Adding "B" to {state["aggregate"]}')
    return {"aggregate": ["B"]}

def b_2(state: State):
    print(f'Adding "B_2" to {state["aggregate"]}')
    return {"aggregate": ["B_2"]}

def c(state: State):
    print(f'Adding "C" to {state["aggregate"]}')
    return {"aggregate": ["C"]}

def d(state: State):
    print(f'Adding "D" to {state["aggregate"]}')
    return {"aggregate": ["D"]}

builder = StateGraph(State)
builder.add_node(a)
builder.add_node(b)
builder.add_node(b_2)
builder.add_node(c)
builder.add_node(d, defer=True)
builder.add_edge(START, "a")
builder.add_edge("a", "b")
builder.add_edge("a", "c")
builder.add_edge("b", "b_2")
builder.add_edge("b_2", "d")
builder.add_edge("c", "d")
builder.add_edge("d", END)
graph = builder.compile()
```

```python
from IPython.display import Image, display

display(Image(graph.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))
```

![Deferred execution graph](assets/graph_api_image_4.png)

```python
graph.invoke({"aggregate": []})
```

```
Adding "A" to []
Adding "B" to ['A']
Adding "C" to ['A']
Adding "B_2" to ['A', 'B', 'C']
Adding "D" to ['A', 'B', 'C', 'B_2']
```

In the above example, nodes `"b"` and `"c"` are executed concurrently in the same superstep. We set `defer=True` on node `d` so it will not execute until all pending tasks are finished. In this case, this means that `"d"` waits to execute until the entire `"b"` branch is finished.

### Conditional branching

If your fan-out should vary at runtime based on the state, you can use [add_conditional_edges](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/reference/graphs.md#langgraph.graph.StateGraph.add_conditional_edges) to select one or more paths using the graph state. See example below, where node `a` generates a state update that determines the following node.

```python hl_lines="14 37"
import operator
from typing import Annotated, Literal, Sequence
from typing_extensions import TypedDict
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END

class State(TypedDict):
    aggregate: Annotated[list, operator.add]
    # Add a key to the state. We will set this key to determine
    # how we branch.
    which: str

def a(state: State):
    print(f'Adding "A" to {state["aggregate"]}')
    return {"aggregate": ["A"], "which": "c"}

def b(state: State):
    print(f'Adding "B" to {state["aggregate"]}')
    return {"aggregate": ["B"]}

def c(state: State):
    print(f'Adding "C" to {state["aggregate"]}')
    return {"aggregate": ["C"]}

builder = StateGraph(State)
builder.add_node(a)
builder.add_node(b)
builder.add_node(c)
builder.add_edge(START, "a")
builder.add_edge("b", END)
builder.add_edge("c", END)

def conditional_edge(state: State) -> Literal["b", "c"]:
    # Fill in arbitrary logic here that uses the state
    # to determine the next node
    return state["which"]

builder.add_conditional_edges("a", conditional_edge)

graph = builder.compile()
```

```python
from IPython.display import Image, display

display(Image(graph.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))
```

![Conditional branching graph](assets/graph_api_image_5.png)

```python
result = graph.invoke({"aggregate": []})
print(result)
```

```
Adding "A" to []
Adding "C" to ['A']
{'aggregate': ['A', 'C'], 'which': 'c'}
```

!!! tip

    Your conditional edges can route to multiple destination nodes. For example:

    ```python
    def route_bc_or_cd(state: State) -> Sequence[str]:
        if state["which"] == "cd":
            return ["c", "d"]
        return ["b", "c"]
    ```
