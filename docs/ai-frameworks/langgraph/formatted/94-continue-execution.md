# Continue execution

for event in graph.stream(Command(resume="baz"), config):
    print(event)
    print("\n")
```

After resuming, the run proceeds through the remaining step and terminates as expected.

### Review tool calls

To review tool calls before execution, we add a `review_tool_call` function that calls [`interrupt`](../how-tos/human_in_the_loop/add-human-in-the-loop.md#pause-using-interrupt). When this function is called, execution will be paused until we issue a command to resume it.

Given a tool call, our function will `interrupt` for human review. At that point we can either:

- Accept the tool call
- Revise the tool call and continue
- Generate a custom tool message (e.g., instructing the model to re-format its tool call)

```python
from typing import Union

def review_tool_call(tool_call: ToolCall) -> Union[ToolCall, ToolMessage]:
    """Review a tool call, returning a validated version."""
    human_review = interrupt(
        {
            "question": "Is this correct?",
            "tool_call": tool_call,
        }
    )
    review_action = human_review["action"]
    review_data = human_review.get("data")
    if review_action == "continue":
        return tool_call
    elif review_action == "update":
        updated_tool_call = {**tool_call, **{"args": review_data}}
        return updated_tool_call
    elif review_action == "feedback":
        return ToolMessage(
            content=review_data, name=tool_call["name"], tool_call_id=tool_call["id"]
        )
```

We can now update our [entrypoint](../concepts/functional_api.md#entrypoint) to review the generated tool calls. If a tool call is accepted or revised, we execute in the same way as before. Otherwise, we just append the `ToolMessage` supplied by the human. The results of prior tasks — in this case the initial model call — are persisted, so that they are not run again following the `interrupt`.

```python
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import InMemorySaver
from langgraph.graph.message import add_messages
from langgraph.types import Command, interrupt

checkpointer = InMemorySaver()

@entrypoint(checkpointer=checkpointer)
def agent(messages, previous):
    if previous is not None:
        messages = add_messages(previous, messages)

    llm_response = call_model(messages).result()
    while True:
        if not llm_response.tool_calls:
            break

        # Review tool calls
        tool_results = []
        tool_calls = []
        for i, tool_call in enumerate(llm_response.tool_calls):
            review = review_tool_call(tool_call)
            if isinstance(review, ToolMessage):
                tool_results.append(review)
            else:  # is a validated tool call
                tool_calls.append(review)
                if review != tool_call:
                    llm_response.tool_calls[i] = review  # update message

        # Execute remaining tool calls
        tool_result_futures = [call_tool(tool_call) for tool_call in tool_calls]
        remaining_tool_results = [fut.result() for fut in tool_result_futures]

        # Append to message list
        messages = add_messages(
            messages,
            [llm_response, *tool_results, *remaining_tool_results],
        )

        # Call model again
        llm_response = call_model(messages).result()

    # Generate final response
    messages = add_messages(messages, llm_response)
    return entrypoint.final(value=llm_response, save=messages)
```
