## Graph Migrations


LangGraph can easily handle migrations of graph definitions (nodes, edges, and state) even when using a checkpointer to track state.

- For threads at the end of the graph (i.e. not interrupted) you can change the entire topology of the graph (i.e. all nodes and edges, remove, add, rename, etc)
- For threads currently interrupted, we support all topology changes other than renaming / removing nodes (as that thread could now be about to enter a node that no longer exists) -- if this is a blocker please reach out and we can prioritize a solution.
- For modifying state, we have full backwards and forwards compatibility for adding and removing keys
- State keys that are renamed lose their saved state in existing threads
- State keys whose types change in incompatible ways could currently cause issues in threads with state from before the change -- if this is a blocker please reach out and we can prioritize a solution.
