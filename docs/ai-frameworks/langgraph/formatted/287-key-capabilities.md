## Key capabilities


* **Persistent execution state**: Interrupts use LangGraph's [persistence](./persistence.md) layer, which saves the graph state, to indefinitely pause graph execution until you resume. This is possible because LangGraph checkpoints the graph state after each step, which allows the system to persist execution context and later resume the workflow, continuing from where it left off. This supports asynchronous human review or input without time constraints.

    There are two ways to pause a graph:

    - [Dynamic interrupts](../how-tos/human_in_the_loop/add-human-in-the-loop.md#pause-using-interrupt): Use `interrupt` to pause a graph from inside a specific node, based on the current state of the graph.
    - [Static interrupts](../how-tos/human_in_the_loop/add-human-in-the-loop.md#debug-with-interrupts): Use `interrupt_before` and `interrupt_after` to pause the graph at pre-defined points, either before or after a node executes.

* **Flexible integration points**: Human-in-the-loop logic can be introduced at any point in the workflow. This allows targeted human involvement, such as approving API calls, correcting outputs, or guiding conversations.
