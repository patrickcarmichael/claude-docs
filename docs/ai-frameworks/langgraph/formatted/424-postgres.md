## Postgres


Postgres is the persistence layer for all user, run, and long-term memory data in a LangGraph Server. This stores both checkpoints (see more info [here](./persistence.md)), server resources (threads, runs, assistants and crons), as well as items saved in the long-term memory store (see more info [here](./persistence.md#memory-store)).
