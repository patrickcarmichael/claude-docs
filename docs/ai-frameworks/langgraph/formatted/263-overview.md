## Overview


LangGraph Platform is a solution for deploying agentic applications in production.
There are three different plans for using it.

- **Developer**: All [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com/) users have access to this plan. You can sign up for this plan simply by creating a LangSmith account. This gives you access to the [local deployment](./deployment_options.md#free-deployment) option.
- **Plus**: All [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com/) users with a [Plus account](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/administration/pricing) have access to this plan. You can sign up for this plan simply by upgrading your LangSmith account to the Plus plan type. This gives you access to the [Cloud](./deployment_options.md#cloud-saas) deployment option.
- **Enterprise**: This is separate from LangSmith plans. You can sign up for this plan by [contacting our sales team](https://www.langchain.com/contact-sales). This gives you access to all [deployment options](./deployment_options.md).
