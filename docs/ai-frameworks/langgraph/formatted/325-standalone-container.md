## Standalone Container


The [Standalone Container](./langgraph_standalone_container.md) deployment option is the least restrictive model for deployment. Deploy standalone instances of a LangGraph Server in your cloud, using any of the [available](./plans.md) license options.

Build a Docker image using the [LangGraph CLI](./langgraph_cli.md) and deploy your LangGraph Server using the container deployment tooling of your choice. Images can be deployed to any compute platform.

For more information, please see:
