# How to integrate LangGraph with AutoGen, CrewAI, and other frameworks


This guide shows how to integrate AutoGen agents with LangGraph to leverage features like persistence, streaming, and memory, and then deploy the integrated solution to LangGraph Platform for scalable production use. In this guide we show how to build a LangGraph chatbot that integrates with AutoGen, but you can follow the same approach with other frameworks.

Integrating AutoGen with LangGraph provides several benefits:

- Enhanced features: Add [persistence](../concepts/persistence.md), [streaming](../concepts/streaming.md), [short and long-term memory](../concepts/memory.md) and more to your AutoGen agents.
- Multi-agent systems: Build [multi-agent systems](../concepts/multi_agent.md) where individual agents are built with different frameworks.
- Production deployment: Deploy your integrated solution to [LangGraph Platform](../concepts/langgraph_platform.md) for scalable production use.
