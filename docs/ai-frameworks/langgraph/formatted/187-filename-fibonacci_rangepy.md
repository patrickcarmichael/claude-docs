This script will print the Fibonacci numbers between 10 and 30. Please execute the code to see the result.

assistant (to user_proxy):

The Fibonacci numbers between 10 and 30 are 13 and 21. 

These numbers are part of the Fibonacci sequence, which is generated by adding the two preceding numbers to get the next number, starting from 0 and 1. 

The sequence goes: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...

As you can see, 13 and 21 are the only numbers in this sequence that fall between 10 and 30.

Since we're leveraging LangGraph's [persistence](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/persistence/) features we can now continue the conversation using the same thread ID -- LangGraph will automatically pass previous history to the AutoGen agent:

```python hl_lines="8"
for chunk in workflow.stream(
    [
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Multiply the last number by 3",
        }
    ],
    config,
):
    print(chunk)
```
```output
user_proxy (to assistant):

Multiply the last number by 3
Context:

assistant (to user_proxy):

The last number in the Fibonacci sequence between 10 and 30 is 21. Multiplying 21 by 3 gives:

21 * 3 = 63
