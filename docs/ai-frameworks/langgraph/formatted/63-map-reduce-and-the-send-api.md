## Map-Reduce and the Send API


LangGraph supports map-reduce and other advanced branching patterns using the Send API. Here is an example of how to use it:

```python
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END
from langgraph.types import Send
from typing_extensions import TypedDict, Annotated
import operator

class OverallState(TypedDict):
    topic: str
    subjects: list[str]
    jokes: Annotated[list[str], operator.add]
    best_selected_joke: str

def generate_topics(state: OverallState):
    return {"subjects": ["lions", "elephants", "penguins"]}

def generate_joke(state: OverallState):
    joke_map = {
        "lions": "Why don't lions like fast food? Because they can't catch it!",
        "elephants": "Why don't elephants use computers? They're afraid of the mouse!",
        "penguins": "Why don't penguins like talking to strangers at parties? Because they find it hard to break the ice."
    }
    return {"jokes": [joke_map[state["subject"]]]}

def continue_to_jokes(state: OverallState):
    return [Send("generate_joke", {"subject": s}) for s in state["subjects"]]

def best_joke(state: OverallState):
    return {"best_selected_joke": "penguins"}

builder = StateGraph(OverallState)
builder.add_node("generate_topics", generate_topics)
builder.add_node("generate_joke", generate_joke)
builder.add_node("best_joke", best_joke)
builder.add_edge(START, "generate_topics")
builder.add_conditional_edges("generate_topics", continue_to_jokes, ["generate_joke"])
builder.add_edge("generate_joke", "best_joke")
builder.add_edge("best_joke", END)
graph = builder.compile()
```

```python
from IPython.display import Image, display

display(Image(graph.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))
```
