## Cloud SaaS


The [Cloud SaaS](./langgraph_cloud.md) deployment option is a fully managed model for deployment where we manage the [control plane](./langgraph_control_plane.md) and [data plane](./langgraph_data_plane.md) in our cloud. This option provides a simple way to deploy and manage your LangGraph Servers.

Connect your GitHub repositories to the platform and deploy your LangGraph Servers from the [control plane UI](./langgraph_control_plane.md#control-plane-ui). The build process (i.e. CI/CD) is managed internally by the platform.

For more information, please see:
