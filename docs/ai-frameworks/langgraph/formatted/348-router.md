## Router


A router allows an LLM to select a single step from a specified set of options. This is an agent architecture that exhibits a relatively limited level of control because the LLM usually focuses on making a single decision and produces a specific output from a limited set of pre-defined options. Routers typically employ a few different concepts to achieve this.

### Structured Output

Structured outputs with LLMs work by providing a specific format or schema that the LLM should follow in its response. This is similar to tool calling, but more general. While tool calling typically involves selecting and using predefined functions, structured outputs can be used for any type of formatted response. Common methods to achieve structured outputs include:

1. Prompt engineering: Instructing the LLM to respond in a specific format via the system prompt.
2. Output parsers: Using post-processing to extract structured data from LLM responses.
3. Tool calling: Leveraging built-in tool calling capabilities of some LLMs to generate structured outputs.

Structured outputs are crucial for routing as they ensure the LLM's decision can be reliably interpreted and acted upon by the system. Learn more about [structured outputs in this how-to guide](https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/structured_output/).
