# Human-in-the-loop


To review, edit, and approve tool calls in an agent or workflow, [use LangGraph's human-in-the-loop features](../how-tos/human_in_the_loop/add-human-in-the-loop.md) to enable human intervention at any point in a workflow. This is especially useful in large language model (LLM)-driven applications where model output may require validation, correction, or additional context.
