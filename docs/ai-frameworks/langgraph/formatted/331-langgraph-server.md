# LangGraph Server


**LangGraph Server** offers an API for creating and managing agent-based applications. It is built on the concept of [assistants](assistants.md), which are agents configured for specific tasks, and includes built-in [persistence](persistence.md#memory-store) and a **task queue**. This versatile API supports a wide range of agentic application use cases, from background processing to real-time interactions.

Use LangGraph Server to create and manage [assistants](assistants.md), [threads](./persistence.md#threads), [runs](./assistants.md#execution), [cron jobs](../cloud/concepts/cron_jobs.md), [webhooks](../cloud/concepts/webhooks.md), and more.
