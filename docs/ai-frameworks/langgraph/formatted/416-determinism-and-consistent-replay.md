## Determinism and Consistent Replay


When you resume a workflow run, the code does **NOT** resume from the **same line of code** where execution stopped; instead, it will identify an appropriate [starting point](#starting-points-for-resuming-workflows) from which to pick up where it left off. This means that the workflow will replay all steps from the [starting point](#starting-points-for-resuming-workflows) until it reaches the point where it was stopped.

As a result, when you are writing a workflow for durable execution, you must wrap any non-deterministic operations (e.g., random number generation) and any operations with side effects (e.g., file writes, API calls) inside [tasks](./functional_api.md#task) or [nodes](./low_level.md#nodes).

To ensure that your workflow is deterministic and can be consistently replayed, follow these guidelines:

- **Avoid Repeating Work**: If a [node](./low_level.md#nodes) contains multiple operations with side effects (e.g., logging, file writes, or network calls), wrap each operation in a separate **task**. This ensures that when the workflow is resumed, the operations are not repeated, and their results are retrieved from the persistence layer.
- **Encapsulate Non-Deterministic Operations:** Wrap any code that might yield non-deterministic results (e.g., random number generation) inside **tasks** or **nodes**. This ensures that, upon resumption, the workflow follows the exact recorded sequence of steps with the same outcomes.
- **Use Idempotent Operations**: When possible ensure that side effects (e.g., API calls, file writes) are idempotent. This means that if an operation is retried after a failure in the workflow, it will have the same effect as the first time it was executed. This is particularly important for operations that result in data writes. In the event that a **task** starts but fails to complete successfully, the workflow's resumption will re-run the **task**, relying on recorded outcomes to maintain consistency. Use idempotency keys or verify existing results to avoid unintended duplication, ensuring a smooth and predictable workflow execution.

For some examples of pitfalls to avoid, see the [Common Pitfalls](./functional_api.md#common-pitfalls) section in the functional API, which shows
how to structure your code using **tasks** to avoid these issues. The same principles apply to the [StateGraph (Graph API)](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/reference/graphs/#langgraph.graph.StateGraph).
