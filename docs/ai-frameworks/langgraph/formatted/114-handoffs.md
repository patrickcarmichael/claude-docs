## Handoffs


To set up communication between the agents in a multi-agent system you can use [**handoffs**](../concepts/multi_agent.md#handoffs) — a pattern where one agent *hands off* control to another. Handoffs allow you to specify:

- **destination**: target agent to navigate to (e.g., name of the LangGraph node to go to)
- **payload**: information to pass to that agent (e.g., state update)

### Create handoffs

To implement handoffs, you can return `Command` objects from your agent nodes or tools:

```python hl_lines="13 14 23 24 25"
from typing import Annotated
from langchain_core.tools import tool, InjectedToolCallId
from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent, InjectedState
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, MessagesState
from langgraph.types import Command

def create_handoff_tool(*, agent_name: str, description: str | None = None):
    name = f"transfer_to_{agent_name}"
    description = description or f"Transfer to {agent_name}"

    @tool(name, description=description)
    def handoff_tool(
        state: Annotated[MessagesState, InjectedState], # (1)!
        tool_call_id: Annotated[str, InjectedToolCallId],
    ) -> Command:
        tool_message = {
            "role": "tool",
            "content": f"Successfully transferred to {agent_name}",
            "name": name,
            "tool_call_id": tool_call_id,
        }
        return Command(  # (2)!
            goto=agent_name,  # (3)!
            update={"messages": state["messages"] + [tool_message]},  # (4)!
            graph=Command.PARENT,  # (5)!
        )
    return handoff_tool
```

1. Access the [state](../concepts/low_level.md#state) of the agent that is calling the handoff tool using the [InjectedState](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/reference/agents/#langgraph.prebuilt.tool_node.InjectedState) annotation. 
2. The `Command` primitive allows specifying a state update and a node transition as a single operation, making it useful for implementing handoffs.
3. Name of the agent or node to hand off to.
4. Take the agent's messages and **add** them to the parent's **state** as part of the handoff. The next agent will see the parent state.
5. Indicate to LangGraph that we need to navigate to agent node in a **parent** multi-agent graph.

!!! tip

    If you want to use tools that return `Command`, you can either use prebuilt [`create_react_agent`](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/reference/prebuilt/#langgraph.prebuilt.chat_agent_executor.create_react_agent) / [`ToolNode`](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/reference/agents/#langgraph.prebuilt.tool_node.ToolNode) components, or implement your own tool-executing node that collects `Command` objects returned by the tools and returns a list of them, e.g.:
    
    ```python
    def call_tools(state):
        ...
        commands = [tools_by_name[tool_call["name"]].invoke(tool_call) for tool_call in tool_calls]
        return commands
    ```

!!! Important

    This handoff implementation assumes that:
    
    - each agent receives overall message history (across all agents) in the multi-agent system as its input. If you want more control over agent inputs, see [this section](#control-agent-inputs)
    - each agent outputs its internal messages history to the overall message history of the multi-agent system. If you want more control over **how agent outputs are added**, wrap the agent in a separate node function:

      ```python hl_lines="5"
      def call_hotel_assistant(state):
          # return agent's final response,
          # excluding inner monologue
          response = hotel_assistant.invoke(state)
          return {"messages": response["messages"][-1]}
      ```

### Control agent inputs

You can use the [`Send()`](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/reference/types/#langgraph.types.Send) primitive to directly send data to the worker agents during the handoff. For example, you can request that the calling agent populate a task description for the next agent:

```python hl_lines="5 26"
from typing import Annotated
from langchain_core.tools import tool, InjectedToolCallId
from langgraph.prebuilt import InjectedState
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, MessagesState
from langgraph.types import Command, Send

def create_task_description_handoff_tool(
    *, agent_name: str, description: str | None = None
):
    name = f"transfer_to_{agent_name}"
    description = description or f"Ask {agent_name} for help."

    @tool(name, description=description)
    def handoff_tool(
        # this is populated by the calling agent
        task_description: Annotated[
            str,
            "Description of what the next agent should do, including all of the relevant context.",
        ],
        # these parameters are ignored by the LLM
        state: Annotated[MessagesState, InjectedState],
    ) -> Command:
        task_description_message = {"role": "user", "content": task_description}
        agent_input = {**state, "messages": [task_description_message]}
        return Command(
            goto=[Send(agent_name, agent_input)],
            graph=Command.PARENT,
        )

    return handoff_tool
```

See the multi-agent [supervisor](../tutorials/multi_agent/agent_supervisor.md#4-create-delegation-tasks) example for a full example of using [`Send()`](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/reference/types/#langgraph.types.Send) in handoffs.
