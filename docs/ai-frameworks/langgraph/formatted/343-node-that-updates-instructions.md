# Node that updates instructions

def update_instructions(state: State, store: BaseStore):
    namespace = ("instructions",)
    current_instructions = store.search(namespace)[0]
    # Memory logic
    prompt = prompt_template.format(instructions=current_instructions.value["instructions"], conversation=state["messages"])
    output = llm.invoke(prompt)
    new_instructions = output['new_instructions']
    store.put(("agent_instructions",), "agent_a", {"instructions": new_instructions})
    ...
```

### Writing memories

There are two primary methods for agents to write memories: ["in the hot path"](#in-the-hot-path) and ["in the background"](#in-the-background).

#### In the hot path

Creating memories during runtime offers both advantages and challenges. On the positive side, this approach allows for real-time updates, making new memories immediately available for use in subsequent interactions. It also enables transparency, as users can be notified when memories are created and stored.

However, this method also presents challenges. It may increase complexity if the agent requires a new tool to decide what to commit to memory. In addition, the process of reasoning about what to save to memory can impact agent latency. Finally, the agent must multitask between memory creation and its other responsibilities, potentially affecting the quantity and quality of memories created.

As an example, ChatGPT uses a [save_memories](https://openai.com/index/memory-and-new-controls-for-chatgpt/) tool to upsert memories as content strings, deciding whether and how to use this tool with each user message. See our [memory-agent](https://github.com/langchain-ai/memory-agent) template as an reference implementation.

#### In the background

Creating memories as a separate background task offers several advantages. It eliminates latency in the primary application, separates application logic from memory management, and allows for more focused task completion by the agent. This approach also provides flexibility in timing memory creation to avoid redundant work.

However, this method has its own challenges. Determining the frequency of memory writing becomes crucial, as infrequent updates may leave other threads without new context. Deciding when to trigger memory formation is also important. Common strategies include scheduling after a set time period (with rescheduling if new events occur), using a cron schedule, or allowing manual triggers by users or the application logic.

See our [memory-service](https://github.com/langchain-ai/memory-template) template as an reference implementation.

### Memory storage

LangGraph stores long-term memories as JSON documents in a [store](persistence.md#memory-store). Each memory is organized under a custom `namespace` (similar to a folder) and a distinct `key` (like a file name). Namespaces often include user or org IDs or other labels that makes it easier to organize information. This structure enables hierarchical organization of memories. Cross-namespace searching is then supported through content filters.

```python
from langgraph.store.memory import InMemoryStore

def embed(texts: list[str]) -> list[list[float]]:
    # Replace with an actual embedding function or LangChain embeddings object
    return [[1.0, 2.0] * len(texts)]
