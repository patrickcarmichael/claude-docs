## Patterns


There are four typical design patterns that you can implement using `interrupt` and `Command`:

- [Approve or reject](../how-tos/human_in_the_loop/add-human-in-the-loop.md#approve-or-reject): Pause the graph before a critical step, such as an API call, to review and approve the action. If the action is rejected, you can prevent the graph from executing the step, and potentially take an alternative action. This pattern often involves routing the graph based on the human's input.
- [Edit graph state](../how-tos/human_in_the_loop/add-human-in-the-loop.md#review-and-edit-state): Pause the graph to review and edit the graph state. This is useful for correcting mistakes or updating the state with additional information. This pattern often involves updating the state with the human's input.
- [Review tool calls](../how-tos/human_in_the_loop/add-human-in-the-loop.md#review-tool-calls): Pause the graph to review and edit tool calls requested by the LLM before tool execution.
- [Validate human input](../how-tos/human_in_the_loop/add-human-in-the-loop.md#validate-human-input): Pause the graph to validate human input before proceeding with the next step.
