## Determinism


To utilize features like **human-in-the-loop**, any randomness should be encapsulated inside of **tasks**. This guarantees that when execution is halted (e.g., for human in the loop) and then resumed, it will follow the same _sequence of steps_, even if **task** results are non-deterministic.

LangGraph achieves this behavior by persisting **task** and [**subgraph**](./subgraphs.md) results as they execute. A well-designed workflow ensures that resuming execution follows the _same sequence of steps_, allowing previously computed results to be retrieved correctly without having to re-execute them. This is particularly useful for long-running **tasks** or **tasks** with non-deterministic results, as it avoids repeating previously done work and allows resuming from essentially the same.

While different runs of a workflow can produce different results, resuming a **specific** run should always follow the same sequence of recorded steps. This allows LangGraph to efficiently look up **task** and **subgraph** results that were executed prior to the graph being interrupted and avoid recomputing them.
