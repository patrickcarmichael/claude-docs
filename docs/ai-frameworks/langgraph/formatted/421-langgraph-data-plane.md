# LangGraph Data Plane


The term "data plane" is used broadly to refer to [LangGraph Servers](./langgraph_server.md) (deployments), the corresponding infrastructure for each server, and the "listener" application that continuously polls for updates from the [LangGraph Control Plane](./langgraph_control_plane.md).
