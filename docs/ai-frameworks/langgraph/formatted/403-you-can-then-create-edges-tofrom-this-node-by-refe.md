# You can then create edges to/from this node by referencing it as `"my_node"`

```

### `START` Node

The `START` Node is a special node that represents the node that sends user input to the graph. The main purpose for referencing this node is to determine which nodes should be called first.

```python
from langgraph.graph import START

graph.add_edge(START, "node_a")
```

### `END` Node

The `END` Node is a special node that represents a terminal node. This node is referenced when you want to denote which edges have no actions after they are done.

```python
from langgraph.graph import END

graph.add_edge("node_a", END)
```

### Node Caching

LangGraph supports caching of tasks/nodes based on the input to the node. To use caching:

- Specify a cache when compiling a graph (or specifying an entrypoint)
- Specify a cache policy for nodes. Each cache policy supports:
  - `key_func` used to generate a cache key based on the input to a node, which defaults to a `hash` of the input with pickle.
  - `ttl`, the time to live for the cache in seconds. If not specified, the cache will never expire.

For example:

```python
import time
from typing_extensions import TypedDict
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph
from langgraph.cache.memory import InMemoryCache
from langgraph.types import CachePolicy

class State(TypedDict):
    x: int
    result: int

builder = StateGraph(State)

def expensive_node(state: State) -> dict[str, int]:
    # expensive computation
    time.sleep(2)
    return {"result": state["x"] * 2}

builder.add_node("expensive_node", expensive_node, cache_policy=CachePolicy(ttl=3))
builder.set_entry_point("expensive_node")
builder.set_finish_point("expensive_node")

graph = builder.compile(cache=InMemoryCache())

print(graph.invoke({"x": 5}, stream_mode='updates'))  # (1)!
[{'expensive_node': {'result': 10}}]
print(graph.invoke({"x": 5}, stream_mode='updates'))  # (2)!
[{'expensive_node': {'result': 10}, '__metadata__': {'cached': True}}]
```

1. First run takes two seconds to run (due to mocked expensive computation).
2. Second run utilizes cache and returns quickly.
