# {'graph_output': 'My name is Lance'}

```

There are two subtle and important points to note here:

1. We pass `state: InputState` as the input schema to `node_1`. But, we write out to `foo`, a channel in `OverallState`. How can we write out to a state channel that is not included in the input schema? This is because a node _can write to any state channel in the graph state._ The graph state is the union of the state channels defined at initialization, which includes `OverallState` and the filters `InputState` and `OutputState`.

2. We initialize the graph with `StateGraph(OverallState,input_schema=InputState,output_schema=OutputState)`. So, how can we write to `PrivateState` in `node_2`? How does the graph gain access to this schema if it was not passed in the `StateGraph` initialization? We can do this because _nodes can also declare additional state channels_ as long as the state schema definition exists. In this case, the `PrivateState` schema is defined, so we can add `bar` as a new state channel in the graph and write to it.

### Reducers

Reducers are key to understanding how updates from nodes are applied to the `State`. Each key in the `State` has its own independent reducer function. If no reducer function is explicitly specified then it is assumed that all updates to that key should override it. There are a few different types of reducers, starting with the default type of reducer:

#### Default Reducer

These two examples show how to use the default reducer:

**Example A:**

```python
from typing_extensions import TypedDict

class State(TypedDict):
    foo: int
    bar: list[str]
```

In this example, no reducer functions are specified for any key. Let's assume the input to the graph is:

`{"foo": 1, "bar": ["hi"]}`. Let's then assume the first `Node` returns `{"foo": 2}`. This is treated as an update to the state. Notice that the `Node` does not need to return the whole `State` schema - just an update. After applying this update, the `State` would then be `{"foo": 2, "bar": ["hi"]}`. If the second node returns `{"bar": ["bye"]}` then the `State` would then be `{"foo": 2, "bar": ["bye"]}`

**Example B:**

```python
from typing import Annotated
from typing_extensions import TypedDict
from operator import add

class State(TypedDict):
    foo: int
    bar: Annotated[list[str], add]
```

In this example, we've used the `Annotated` type to specify a reducer function (`operator.add`) for the second key (`bar`). Note that the first key remains unchanged. Let's assume the input to the graph is `{"foo": 1, "bar": ["hi"]}`. Let's then assume the first `Node` returns `{"foo": 2}`. This is treated as an update to the state. Notice that the `Node` does not need to return the whole `State` schema - just an update. After applying this update, the `State` would then be `{"foo": 2, "bar": ["hi"]}`. If the second node returns `{"bar": ["bye"]}` then the `State` would then be `{"foo": 2, "bar": ["hi", "bye"]}`. Notice here that the `bar` key is updated by adding the two lists together.

### Working with Messages in Graph State

#### Why use messages?

Most modern LLM providers have a chat model interface that accepts a list of messages as input. LangChain's [`ChatModel`](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/#chat-models) in particular accepts a list of `Message` objects as inputs. These messages come in a variety of forms such as `HumanMessage` (user input) or `AIMessage` (LLM response). To read more about what message objects are, please refer to [this](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/#messages) conceptual guide.

#### Using Messages in your Graph

In many cases, it is helpful to store prior conversation history as a list of messages in your graph state. To do so, we can add a key (channel) to the graph state that stores a list of `Message` objects and annotate it with a reducer function (see `messages` key in the example below). The reducer function is vital to telling the graph how to update the list of `Message` objects in the state with each state update (for example, when a node sends an update). If you don't specify a reducer, every state update will overwrite the list of messages with the most recently provided value. If you wanted to simply append messages to the existing list, you could use `operator.add` as a reducer.

However, you might also want to manually update messages in your graph state (e.g. human-in-the-loop). If you were to use `operator.add`, the manual state updates you send to the graph would be appended to the existing list of messages, instead of updating existing messages. To avoid that, you need a reducer that can keep track of message IDs and overwrite existing messages, if updated. To achieve this, you can use the prebuilt `add_messages` function. For brand new messages, it will simply append to existing list, but it will also handle the updates for existing messages correctly.

#### Serialization

In addition to keeping track of message IDs, the `add_messages` function will also try to deserialize messages into LangChain `Message` objects whenever a state update is received on the `messages` channel. See more information on LangChain serialization/deserialization [here](https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/serialization/). This allows sending graph inputs / state updates in the following format:
