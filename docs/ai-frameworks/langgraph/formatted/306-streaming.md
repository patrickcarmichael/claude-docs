# Streaming


LangGraph implements a streaming system to surface real-time updates, allowing for responsive and transparent user experiences.

LangGraph’s streaming system lets you surface live feedback from graph runs to your app.  
There are three main categories of data you can stream:

1. **Workflow progress** — get state updates after each graph node is executed.
2. **LLM tokens** — stream language model tokens as they’re generated.
3. **Custom updates** — emit user-defined signals (e.g., “Fetched 10/100 records”).
