## Rollback


This option interrupts the current execution AND rolls back all work done up until that point, including the original run input. It then sends the new user input in, basically as if it was the original input.

See the [how-to guide](../cloud/how-tos/rollback_concurrent.md) for configuring the rollback double text option.
