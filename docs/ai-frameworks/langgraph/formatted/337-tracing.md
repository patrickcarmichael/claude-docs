# Tracing


Traces are a series of steps that your application takes to go from input to output. Each of these individual steps is represented by a run. You can use [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com/) to visualize these execution steps. To use it, [enable tracing for your application](../how-tos/enable-tracing.md). This enables you to do the following:

- [Debug a locally running application](../cloud/how-tos/clone_traces_studio.md).
- [Evaluate the application performance](../agents/evals.md).
- [Monitor the application](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/observability/how_to_guides/dashboards).

To get started, sign up for a free account at [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com/).
