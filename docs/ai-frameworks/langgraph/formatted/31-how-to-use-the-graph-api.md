# How to use the graph API


This guide demonstrates the basics of LangGraph's Graph API. It walks through [state](#define-and-update-state), as well as composing common graph structures such as [sequences](#create-a-sequence-of-steps), [branches](#create-branches), and [loops](#create-and-control-loops). It also covers LangGraph's control features, including the [Send API](#map-reduce-and-the-send-api) for map-reduce workflows and the [Command API](#combine-control-flow-and-state-updates-with-command) for combining state updates with "hops" across nodes.
