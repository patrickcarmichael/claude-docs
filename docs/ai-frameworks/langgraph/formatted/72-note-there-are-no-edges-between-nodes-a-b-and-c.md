# NOTE: there are no edges between nodes A, B and C!


graph = builder.compile()
```

!!! important

    You might have noticed that we used `Command` as a return type annotation, e.g. `Command[Literal["node_b", "node_c"]]`. This is necessary for the graph rendering and tells LangGraph that `node_a` can navigate to `node_b` and `node_c`.

```python
from IPython.display import display, Image

display(Image(graph.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))
```

![Command-based graph navigation](assets/graph_api_image_11.png)

If we run the graph multiple times, we'd see it take different paths (A -> B or A -> C) based on the random choice in node A.

```python
graph.invoke({"foo": ""})
```

```
Called A
Called C
```

### Navigate to a node in a parent graph

If you are using [subgraphs](../concepts/subgraphs.md), you might want to navigate from a node within a subgraph to a different subgraph (i.e. a different node in the parent graph). To do so, you can specify `graph=Command.PARENT` in `Command`:

```python
def my_node(state: State) -> Command[Literal["my_other_node"]]:
    return Command(
        update={"foo": "bar"},
        goto="other_subgraph",  # where `other_subgraph` is a node in the parent graph
        graph=Command.PARENT
    )
```

Let's demonstrate this using the above example. We'll do so by changing `nodeA` in the above example into a single-node graph that we'll add as a subgraph to our parent graph.

!!! important "State updates with `Command.PARENT`"

    When you send updates from a subgraph node to a parent graph node for a key that's shared by both parent and subgraph [state schemas](../concepts/low_level.md#schema), you **must** define a [reducer](../concepts/low_level.md#reducers) for the key you're updating in the parent graph state. See the example below.

```python hl_lines="6 23 33 37"
import operator
from typing_extensions import Annotated

class State(TypedDict):
    # NOTE: we define a reducer here
    foo: Annotated[str, operator.add]

def node_a(state: State):
    print("Called A")
    value = random.choice(["a", "b"])
    # this is a replacement for a conditional edge function
    if value == "a":
        goto = "node_b"
    else:
        goto = "node_c"

    # note how Command allows you to BOTH update the graph state AND route to the next node
    return Command(
        update={"foo": value},
        goto=goto,
        # this tells LangGraph to navigate to node_b or node_c in the parent graph
        # NOTE: this will navigate to the closest parent graph relative to the subgraph
        graph=Command.PARENT,
    )

subgraph = StateGraph(State).add_node(node_a).add_edge(START, "node_a").compile()

def node_b(state: State):
    print("Called B")
    # NOTE: since we've defined a reducer, we don't need to manually append
    # new characters to existing 'foo' value. instead, reducer will append these
    # automatically (via operator.add)
    return {"foo": "b"}

def node_c(state: State):
    print("Called C")
    return {"foo": "c"}

builder = StateGraph(State)
builder.add_edge(START, "subgraph")
builder.add_node("subgraph", subgraph)
builder.add_node(node_b)
builder.add_node(node_c)

graph = builder.compile()
```

```python
graph.invoke({"foo": ""})
```

```
Called A
Called C
```

### Use inside tools

A common use case is updating graph state from inside a tool. For example, in a customer support application you might want to look up customer information based on their account number or ID in the beginning of the conversation. To update the graph state from the tool, you can return `Command(update={"my_custom_key": "foo", "messages": [...]})` from the tool:

```python
@tool
def lookup_user_info(tool_call_id: Annotated[str, InjectedToolCallId], config: RunnableConfig):
    """Use this to look up user information to better assist them with their questions."""
    user_info = get_user_info(config.get("configurable", {}).get("user_id"))
    return Command(
        update={
            # update the state keys
            "user_info": user_info,
            # update the message history
            "messages": [ToolMessage("Successfully looked up user information", tool_call_id=tool_call_id)]
        }
    )
```

!!! important

    You MUST include `messages` (or any state key used for the message history) in `Command.update` when returning `Command` from a tool and the list of messages in `messages` MUST contain a `ToolMessage`. This is necessary for the resulting message history to be valid (LLM providers require AI messages with tool calls to be followed by the tool result messages).

If you are using tools that update state via `Command`, we recommend using prebuilt [`ToolNode`](../reference/agents.md#langgraph.prebuilt.tool_node.ToolNode) which automatically handles tools returning `Command` objects and propagates them to the graph state. If you're writing a custom node that calls tools, you would need to manually propagate `Command` objects returned by the tools as the update from the node.
