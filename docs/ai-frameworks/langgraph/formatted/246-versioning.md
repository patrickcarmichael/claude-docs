## Versioning


Assistants support versioning to track changes over time.
Once you've created an assistant, subsequent edits to that assistant will create new versions. See [this how-to](../cloud/how-tos/configuration_cloud.md#create-a-new-version-for-your-assistant) for more details on how to manage assistant versions.
