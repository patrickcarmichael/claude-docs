## Short-term memory


[Short-term memory](../how-tos/memory/add-memory.md#add-short-term-memory) lets your application remember previous interactions within a single [thread](persistence.md#threads) or conversation. A [thread](persistence.md#threads) organizes multiple interactions in a session, similar to the way email groups messages in a single conversation.

LangGraph manages short-term memory as part of the agent's state, persisted via thread-scoped checkpoints. This state can normally include the conversation history along with other stateful data, such as uploaded files, retrieved documents, or generated artifacts. By storing these in the graph's state, the bot can access the full context for a given conversation while maintaining separation between different threads.

### Manage short-term memory

Conversation history is the most common form of short-term memory, and long conversations pose a challenge to today's LLMs. A full history may not fit inside an LLM's context window, resulting in an irrecoverable error. Even if your LLM supports the full context length, most LLMs still perform poorly over long contexts. They get "distracted" by stale or off-topic content, all while suffering from slower response times and higher costs.

Chat models accept context using messages, which include developer provided instructions (a system message) and user inputs (human messages). In chat applications, messages alternate between human inputs and model responses, resulting in a list of messages that grows longer over time. Because context windows are limited and token-rich message lists can be costly, many applications can benefit from using techniques to manually remove or forget stale information.
