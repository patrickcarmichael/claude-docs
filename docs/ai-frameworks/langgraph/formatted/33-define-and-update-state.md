## Define and update state


Here we show how to define and update [state](../concepts/low_level.md#state) in LangGraph. We will demonstrate:

1. How to use state to define a graph's [schema](../concepts/low_level.md#schema)
2. How to use [reducers](../concepts/low_level.md#reducers) to control how state updates are processed.

### Define state

[State](../concepts/low_level.md#state) in LangGraph can be a `TypedDict`, `Pydantic` model, or dataclass. Below we will use `TypedDict`. See [this section](#use-pydantic-models-for-graph-state) for detail on using Pydantic.

By default, graphs will have the same input and output schema, and the state determines that schema. See [this section](#define-input-and-output-schemas) for how to define distinct input and output schemas.

Let's consider a simple example using [messages](../concepts/low_level.md#working-with-messages-in-graph-state). This represents a versatile formulation of state for many LLM applications. See our [concepts page](../concepts/low_level.md#working-with-messages-in-graph-state) for more detail.

```python
from langchain_core.messages import AnyMessage
from typing_extensions import TypedDict

class State(TypedDict):
    messages: list[AnyMessage]
    extra_field: int
```

This state tracks a list of [message](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/messages/) objects, as well as an extra integer field.

### Update state

Let's build an example graph with a single node. Our [node](../concepts/low_level.md#nodes) is just a Python function that reads our graph's state and makes updates to it. The first argument to this function will always be the state:

```python
from langchain_core.messages import AIMessage

def node(state: State):
    messages = state["messages"]
    new_message = AIMessage("Hello!")
    return {"messages": messages + [new_message], "extra_field": 10}
```

This node simply appends a message to our message list, and populates an extra field.

!!! important

    Nodes should return updates to the state directly, instead of mutating the state.

Let's next define a simple graph containing this node. We use [StateGraph](../concepts/low_level.md#stategraph) to define a graph that operates on this state. We then use [add_node](../concepts/low_level.md#nodes) populate our graph.

```python
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph

builder = StateGraph(State)
builder.add_node(node)
builder.set_entry_point("node")
graph = builder.compile()
```

LangGraph provides built-in utilities for visualizing your graph. Let's inspect our graph. See [this section](#visualize-your-graph) for detail on visualization.

```python
from IPython.display import Image, display

display(Image(graph.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))
```

![Simple graph with single node](assets/graph_api_image_1.png)

In this case, our graph just executes a single node. Let's proceed with a simple invocation:

```python
from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage

result = graph.invoke({"messages": [HumanMessage("Hi")]})
result
```

```json
{'messages': [HumanMessage(content='Hi'), AIMessage(content='Hello!')], 'extra_field': 10}
```

Note that:

- We kicked off invocation by updating a single key of the state.
- We receive the entire state in the invocation result.

For convenience, we frequently inspect the content of [message objects](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/messages/) via pretty-print:

```python
for message in result["messages"]:
    message.pretty_print()
```

```
================================ Human Message ================================

Hi
================================== Ai Message ==================================

Hello!
```

### Process state updates with reducers

Each key in the state can have its own independent [reducer](../concepts/low_level.md#reducers) function, which controls how updates from nodes are applied. If no reducer function is explicitly specified then it is assumed that all updates to the key should override it.

For `TypedDict` state schemas, we can define reducers by annotating the corresponding field of the state with a reducer function.

In the earlier example, our node updated the `"messages"` key in the state by appending a message to it. Below, we add a reducer to this key, such that updates are automatically appended:

```python hl_lines="8"
from typing_extensions import Annotated

def add(left, right):
    """Can also import `add` from the `operator` built-in."""
    return left + right

class State(TypedDict):
    messages: Annotated[list[AnyMessage], add]
    extra_field: int
```

Now our node can be simplified:

```python hl_lines="3"
def node(state: State):
    new_message = AIMessage("Hello!")
    return {"messages": [new_message], "extra_field": 10}
```

```python
from langgraph.graph import START

graph = StateGraph(State).add_node(node).add_edge(START, "node").compile()

result = graph.invoke({"messages": [HumanMessage("Hi")]})

for message in result["messages"]:
    message.pretty_print()
```

```
================================ Human Message ================================

Hi
================================== Ai Message ==================================

Hello!
```

#### MessagesState

In practice, there are additional considerations for updating lists of messages:

- We may wish to update an existing message in the state.
- We may want to accept short-hands for [message formats](../concepts/low_level.md#using-messages-in-your-graph), such as [OpenAI format](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/messages/#openai-format).

LangGraph includes a built-in reducer `add_messages` that handles these considerations:

```python hl_lines="4"
from langgraph.graph.message import add_messages

class State(TypedDict):
    messages: Annotated[list[AnyMessage], add_messages]
    extra_field: int

def node(state: State):
    new_message = AIMessage("Hello!")
    return {"messages": [new_message], "extra_field": 10}

graph = StateGraph(State).add_node(node).set_entry_point("node").compile()
```

```python hl_lines="1"
input_message = {"role": "user", "content": "Hi"}

result = graph.invoke({"messages": [input_message]})

for message in result["messages"]:
    message.pretty_print()
```

```
================================ Human Message ================================

Hi
================================== Ai Message ==================================

Hello!
```

This is a versatile representation of state for applications involving [chat models](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/chat_models/). LangGraph includes a pre-built `MessagesState` for convenience, so that we can have:

```python
from langgraph.graph import MessagesState

class State(MessagesState):
    extra_field: int
```

### Define input and output schemas

By default, `StateGraph` operates with a single schema, and all nodes are expected to communicate using that schema. However, it's also possible to define distinct input and output schemas for a graph.

When distinct schemas are specified, an internal schema will still be used for communication between nodes. The input schema ensures that the provided input matches the expected structure, while the output schema filters the internal data to return only the relevant information according to the defined output schema.

Below, we'll see how to define distinct input and output schema.

```python
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END
from typing_extensions import TypedDict
