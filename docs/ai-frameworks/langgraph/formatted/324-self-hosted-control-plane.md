## Self-Hosted Control Plane


!!! info "Important"
    The Self-Hosted Control Plane deployment option requires an [Enterprise](../concepts/plans.md) plan.

The [Self-Hosted Control Plane](./langgraph_self_hosted_control_plane.md) deployment option is a fully self-hosted model for deployment where you manage the [control plane](./langgraph_control_plane.md) and [data plane](./langgraph_data_plane.md) in your cloud. This option gives you full control and responsibility of the control plane and data plane infrastructure.

Build a Docker image using the [LangGraph CLI](./langgraph_cli.md) and deploy your LangGraph Server from the [control plane UI](./langgraph_control_plane.md#control-plane-ui).

Supported Compute Platforms: [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)
