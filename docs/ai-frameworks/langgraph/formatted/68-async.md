## Async


Using the async programming paradigm can produce significant performance improvements when running [IO-bound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I/O_bound) code concurrently (e.g., making concurrent API requests to a chat model provider).

To convert a `sync` implementation of the graph to an `async` implementation, you will need to:

1. Update `nodes` use `async def` instead of `def`.
2. Update the code inside to use `await` appropriately.
3. Invoke the graph with `.ainvoke` or `.astream` as desired.

Because many LangChain objects implement the [Runnable Protocol](https://python.langchain.com/docs/expression_language/interface/) which has `async` variants of all the `sync` methods it's typically fairly quick to upgrade a `sync` graph to an `async` graph.

See example below. To demonstrate async invocations of underlying LLMs, we will include a chat model:

{% include-markdown "../../snippets/chat_model_tabs.md" %}

```python hl_lines="4 5 12"
from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model
from langgraph.graph import MessagesState, StateGraph

async def node(state: MessagesState): # (1)!
    new_message = await llm.ainvoke(state["messages"]) # (2)!
    return {"messages": [new_message]}

builder = StateGraph(MessagesState).add_node(node).set_entry_point("node")
graph = builder.compile()

input_message = {"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}
result = await graph.ainvoke({"messages": [input_message]}) # (3)!
```

1. Declare nodes to be async functions.
2. Use async invocations when available within the node.
3. Use async invocations on the graph object itself.

    See the [streaming guide](./streaming.md) for examples of streaming with async.
