# How to create a ReAct agent from scratch


!!! info "Prerequisites"
    This guide assumes familiarity with the following:
    
    - <a href="../../concepts/agentic_concepts/#tool-calling-agent">Tool calling agent</a>
    - [Chat Models](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/chat_models/)
    - [Messages](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/messages/)
    - <a href="../../concepts/low_level/">LangGraph Glossary</a>

Using the prebuilt ReAct agent [create_react_agent][langgraph.prebuilt.chat_agent_executor.create_react_agent] is a great way to get started, but sometimes you might want more control and customization. In those cases, you can create a custom ReAct agent. This guide shows how to implement ReAct agent from scratch using LangGraph.
