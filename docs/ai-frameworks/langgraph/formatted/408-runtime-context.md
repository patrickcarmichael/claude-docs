## Runtime Context


When creating a graph, you can specify a `context_schema` for runtime context passed to nodes. This is useful for passing
information to nodes that is not part of the graph state. For example, you might want to pass dependencies such as model name or a database connection.

```python
@dataclass
class ContextSchema:
    llm_provider: str = "openai"

graph = StateGraph(State, context_schema=ContextSchema)
```

You can then pass this context into the graph using the `context` parameter of the `invoke` method.

```python
graph.invoke(inputs, context={"llm_provider": "anthropic"})
```

You can then access and use this context inside a node or conditional edge:

```python
from langgraph.runtime import Runtime

def node_a(state: State, runtime: Runtime[ContextSchema]):
    llm = get_llm(runtime.context.llm_provider)
    ...
```

See [this guide](../how-tos/graph-api.md#add-runtime-configuration) for a full breakdown on configuration.

### Recursion Limit

The recursion limit sets the maximum number of [super-steps](#graphs) the graph can execute during a single execution. Once the limit is reached, LangGraph will raise `GraphRecursionError`. By default this value is set to 25 steps. The recursion limit can be set on any graph at runtime, and is passed to `.invoke`/`.stream` via the config dictionary. Importantly, `recursion_limit` is a standalone `config` key and should not be passed inside the `configurable` key as all other user-defined configuration. See the example below:

```python
graph.invoke(inputs, config={"recursion_limit": 5}, context={"llm": "anthropic"})
```
