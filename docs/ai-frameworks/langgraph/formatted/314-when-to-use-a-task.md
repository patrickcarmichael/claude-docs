## When to use a task


**Tasks** are useful in the following scenarios:

- **Checkpointing**: When you need to save the result of a long-running operation to a checkpoint, so you don't need to recompute it when resuming the workflow.
- **Human-in-the-loop**: If you're building a workflow that requires human intervention, you MUST use **tasks** to encapsulate any randomness (e.g., API calls) to ensure that the workflow can be resumed correctly. See the [determinism](#determinism) section for more details.
- **Parallel Execution**: For I/O-bound tasks, **tasks** enable parallel execution, allowing multiple operations to run concurrently without blocking (e.g., calling multiple APIs).
- **Observability**: Wrapping operations in **tasks** provides a way to track the progress of the workflow and monitor the execution of individual operations using [LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/).
- **Retryable Work**: When work needs to be retried to handle failures or inconsistencies, **tasks** provide a way to encapsulate and manage the retry logic.
