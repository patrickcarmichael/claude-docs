# pass the thread ID to persist agent outputs for future interactions

config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "1"}}

for chunk in graph.stream(
    {
        "messages": [
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": "Find numbers between 10 and 30 in fibonacci sequence",
            }
        ]
    },
    config,
):
    print(chunk)
```

**Output:**
```
user_proxy (to assistant):

Find numbers between 10 and 30 in fibonacci sequence

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
assistant (to user_proxy):

To find numbers between 10 and 30 in the Fibonacci sequence, we can generate the Fibonacci sequence and check which numbers fall within this range. Here's a plan:

1. Generate Fibonacci numbers starting from 0.
2. Continue generating until the numbers exceed 30.
3. Collect and print the numbers that are between 10 and 30.

...
```

Since we're leveraging LangGraph's [persistence](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/persistence/) features we can now continue the conversation using the same thread ID -- LangGraph will automatically pass previous history to the AutoGen agent:

```python hl_lines="10"
for chunk in graph.stream(
    {
        "messages": [
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": "Multiply the last number by 3",
            }
        ]
    },
    config,
):
    print(chunk)
```

**Output:**
```
user_proxy (to assistant):

Multiply the last number by 3
Context: 
Find numbers between 10 and 30 in fibonacci sequence
The Fibonacci numbers between 10 and 30 are 13 and 21. 

These numbers are part of the Fibonacci sequence, which is generated by adding the two preceding numbers to get the next number, starting from 0 and 1. 

The sequence goes: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...

As you can see, 13 and 21 are the only numbers in this sequence that fall between 10 and 30.

TERMINATE

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
assistant (to user_proxy):

The last number in the Fibonacci sequence between 10 and 30 is 21. Multiplying 21 by 3 gives:

21 * 3 = 63

TERMINATE

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
{'call_autogen_agent': {'messages': {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'The last number in the Fibonacci sequence between 10 and 30 is 21. Multiplying 21 by 3 gives:\n\n21 * 3 = 63\n\nTERMINATE'}}}
```
