## Exposing an agent as MCP tool


When deployed, your agent will appear as a tool in the MCP endpoint
with this configuration:

- **Tool name**: The agent's name.
- **Tool description**: The agent's description.
- **Tool input schema**: The agent's input schema.

### Setting name and description

You can set the name and description of your agent in `langgraph.json`:

```json
{
  "graphs": {
    "my_agent": {
      "path": "./my_agent/agent.py:graph",
      "description": "A description of what the agent does"
    }
  },
  "env": ".env"
}
```

After deployment, you can update the name and description using the LangGraph SDK.

### Schema

Define clear, minimal input and output schemas to avoid exposing unnecessary internal complexity to the LLM.

The default [MessagesState](./low_level.md#messagesstate) uses `AnyMessage`, which supports many message types but is too general for direct LLM exposure.

Instead, define **custom agents or workflows** that use explicitly typed input and output structures.

For example, a workflow answering documentation questions might look like this:

```python
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END
from typing_extensions import TypedDict
