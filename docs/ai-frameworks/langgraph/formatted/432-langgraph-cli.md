# LangGraph CLI


**LangGraph CLI** is a multi-platform command-line tool for building and running the [LangGraph API server](./langgraph_server.md) locally. The resulting server includes all API endpoints for your graph's runs, threads, assistants, etc. as well as the other services required to run your agent, including a managed database for checkpointing and storage.
