## View the trace in LangSmith


Now that we've ran our graph, let's head over to LangSmith and view our trace. First click into the project that you traced to (in our case the default project). You should see a run with the custom run name "agent_007".

In addition, you will be able to filter traces after the fact using the tags or metadata provided. For example,
