# LangGraph

**Build Stateful, Multi-Actor Applications with LLMs** | 618KB

LangGraph is a framework for building stateful, multi-actor applications with LLMs. It extends the LangChain ecosystem to enable more complex agentic workflows with cycles, persistence, and human-in-the-loop patterns.

- **Focus**: Stateful agents, complex workflows, multi-agent systems
- **Language**: Python, TypeScript
- **Maturity**: Production-ready, rapidly evolving
- **Best For**: Complex agent workflows, multi-agent systems, stateful applications
- **Philosophy**: Graph-based workflows, state management, persistence

## Key Features

- **State Management**: Persistent, checkpointed agent state
- **Graph-Based Workflows**: Define complex agent behaviors as graphs
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Pause and resume workflows for human intervention
- **Multi-Agent Systems**: Coordinate multiple agents with shared state
- **Streaming**: Real-time streaming of agent actions and state
