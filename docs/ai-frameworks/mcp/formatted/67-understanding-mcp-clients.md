# Understanding MCP clients


Source: https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/learn/client-concepts

MCP clients are instantiated by host applications to communicate with particular MCP servers. The host application, like Claude.ai or an IDE, manages the overall user experience and coordinates multiple clients. Each client handles one direct communication with one server.

Understanding the distinction is important: the *host* is the application users interact with, while *clients* are the protocol-level components that enable server connections.
