## FAQ


### How do I get involved contributing to MCP?

These IG and WG abstractions help provide an elegant on-ramp:

1. [Join the Discord](/community/communication#discord) and follow conversations in IGs relevant to you. Attend [live calls](https://meet.modelcontextprotocol.io/). Participate.
2. Offer to facilitate calls. Contribute your use cases in SEP proposals and other work.
3. When you're comfortable contributing to deliverables, jump in to contribute to WG work.
4. Active and valuable contributors will be nominated by WG maintainers as new maintainers.

### Where can I find a list of all current WGs and IGs?

On the [MCP Contributor Discord](/community/communication#discord) there is a section of channels for each Working and Interest Group.
