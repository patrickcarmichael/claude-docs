## What qualifies a SEP?


The goal is to reserve the SEP process for changes that are substantial enough to require broad community discussion, a formal design document, and a historical record of the decision-making process. A regular GitHub issue or pull request is often more appropriate for smaller, more direct changes.

Consider proposing a SEP if your change involves any of the following:

* **A New Feature or Protocol Change**: Any change that adds, modifies, or removes features in the Model Context Protocol. This includes:
  * Adding new API endpoints or methods.
  * Changing the syntax or semantics of existing data structures or messages.
  * Introducing a new standard for interoperability between different MCP-compatible tools.
  * Significant changes to how the specification itself is defined, presented, or validated.
* **A Breaking Change**: Any change that is not backwards-compatible.
* **A Change to Governance or Process**: Any proposal that alters the project's decision-making, contribution guidelines (like this document itself).
* **A Complex or Controversial Topic**: If a change is likely to have multiple valid solutions or generate significant debate, the SEP process provides the necessary framework to explore alternatives, document the rationale, and build community consensus before implementation begins.
