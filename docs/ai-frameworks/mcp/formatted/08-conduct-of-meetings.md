## Conduct of Meetings


At meetings among actual or potential competitors, there is a risk that participants in those meetings may improperly disclose or discuss information in violation of the Antitrust Laws or otherwise act in an anti-competitive manner. To avoid this risk, participants must adhere to the following policies when participating in Project-related or sponsored meetings, conference calls, or other forums (collectively, "Project Meetings").

Participants must not, in fact or appearance, discuss or exchange information regarding:

* An individual company's current or projected prices, price changes, price differentials, markups, discounts, allowances, terms and conditions of sale, including credit terms, etc., or data that bear on prices, including profits, margins or cost.
* Industry-wide pricing policies, price levels, price changes, differentials, or the like.
* Actual or projected changes in industry production, capacity or inventories.
* Matters relating to bids or intentions to bid for particular products, procedures for responding to bid invitations or specific contractual arrangements.
* Plans of individual companies concerning the design, characteristics, production, distribution, marketing or introduction dates of particular products, including proposed territories or customers.
* Matters relating to actual or potential individual suppliers that might have the effect of excluding them from any market or of influencing the business conduct of firms toward such suppliers.
* Matters relating to actual or potential customers that might have the effect of influencing the business conduct of firms toward such customers.
* Individual company current or projected cost of procurement, development or manufacture of any product.
* Individual company market shares for any product or for all products.
* Confidential or otherwise sensitive business plans or strategy.

In connection with all Project Meetings, participants must do the following:

* Adhere to prepared agendas.
* Insist that meeting minutes be prepared and distributed to all participants, and that meeting minutes accurately reflect the matters that transpired.
* Consult with their respective counsel on all antitrust questions related to Project Meetings.
* Protest against any discussions that appear to violate these policies or the Antitrust Laws, leave any meeting in which such discussions continue, and either insist that such protest be noted in the minutes.
