## Processes


Core and lead maintainers are responsible for all aspects of Model Context Protocol, including documentation, issues, suggestions for content, and all other parts under the [MCP project](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol). Maintainers are responsible for documentation, issues, and suggestions of content for their area of the MCP project, but are encouraged to partake in general maintenance of the MCP projects. Maintainers, core maintainers, and lead maintainers should use the same contribution process as external contributors, rather than making direct changes to repos. This provides insight into intent and opportunity for discussion.

### Working and Interest Groups

MCP collaboration and contributions are organized around two structures: [Working Groups and Interest Groups](/community/working-interest-groups).

Interest Groups are responsible for identifying and articulating problems that MCP should address, primarily by facilitating open discussions within the community. In contrast, Working Groups focus on developing concrete solutions by collaboratively producing deliverables, such as SEPs or community-owned implementations of the specification. While input from Interest Groups can help justify the formation of a Working Group, it is not a strict requirement. Similarly, contributions from either Interest Groups or Working Groups are encouraged, but not mandatory, when submitting SEPs or other community proposals.

We strongly encourage all contributors interested in working on a specific SEP to first collaborate within an Interest Group. This collaborative process helps ensure that the proposed SEP aligns with protocol needs and is the right direction for its adopters.

#### Governance Principles

All groups are self-governed while adhering to these core principles:

1. Clear contribution and decision-making processes
2. Open communication and transparent decisions

Both must:

* Document their contribution process
* Maintain transparent communication
* Make decisions publicly (groups must publish meeting notes and proposals)

Projects and working groups without specified processes default to:

* GitHub pull requests and issues for contributions
* A public channel in the official [MCP Contributor Discord](/community/communication#discord)

#### Maintenance Responsibilities

Components without dedicated maintainers (such as documentation) fall under core maintainer responsibility. These follow standard contribution guidelines through pull requests, with maintainers handling reviews and escalating to core maintainer review for any significant changes.

Core maintainers and maintainers are encouraged to improve any part of the MCP project, regardless of formal maintenance assignments.

### Specification Project

#### Specification Enhancement Proposal (SEP)

Proposed changes to the specification must come in the form of a written version, starting with a summary of the proposal, outlining the **problem** it tries to solve, propose **solution**, **alternatives**, **considerations, outcomes** and **risks**. The [SEP Guidelines](/community/sep-guidelines) outline information on the expected structure of SEPs. SEP's should be created as issues in the [specification repository](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/specification) and tagged with the labels `proposal, sep`.

All proposals must have a **sponsor** from the MCP steering group (maintainer, core maintainer or lead core maintainer). The sponsor is responsible for ensuring that the proposal is actively developed, meets the quality standard for proposals and is responsible for presenting and discussing it in meetings of core maintainers. Maintainer and Core Maintainer groups should review open proposals without sponsors in regular intervals. Proposals that do not find a sponsor within six months are automatically rejected.

Once proposals have a sponsor, they are assigned to the sponsor and are tagged `draft`.
