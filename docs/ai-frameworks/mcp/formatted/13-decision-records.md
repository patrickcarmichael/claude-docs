## Decision Records


All MCP decisions are documented and captured in public channels.

* **Technical decisions**: [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/issues) and SEPs.
* **Specification changes**: [On the Model Context Protocol website](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/draft/changelog).
* **Process changes**: [Community documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/community/governance).
* **Governance decisions and updates**: [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/issues) and SEPs.

When documenting decisions, we will retain as much context as possible:

* Decision makers
* Background context and motivation
* Options that were considered
* Rationale for the chosen approach
* Implementation steps
