## Communication


### Core Maintainer Meetings

The core maintainer group meets on a bi-weekly basis to discuss proposals and the project. Notes on proposals should be made public. The core maintainer group will strive to meet in person every 3-6 months.

### Public Chat

The MCP project maintains a [public Discord server](/community/communication#discord) with open chats for interest groups. The MCP project may have private channels for certain communications.
