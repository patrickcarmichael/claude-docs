## Meeting Calendar


All Interest Group and Working Group meetings are published on the public MCP community calendar at [meet.modelcontextprotocol.io](https://meet.modelcontextprotocol.io/).

Facilitators are responsible for posting their meeting schedules to this calendar in advance to ensure discoverability and enable broader community participation.

### Interest Groups (IGs)

**Goal:** Facilitate discussion and knowledge-sharing among MCP contributors who share interests in a specific MCP sub-topic or context. The primary focus is on identifying and gathering problems that may be worth addressing through SEPs or other community artifacts, while encouraging open exploration of protocol issues and opportunities.

**Expectations**:

* Regular conversations in the Interest Group Discord channel
* **AND/OR** a recurring live meeting regularly attended by Interest Group members
* Meeting dates and times published in advance on the [MCP community calendar](https://meet.modelcontextprotocol.io/) when applicable, and tagged with their primary topic and interest group Discord channel name (e.g. `auth-ig`)
* Notes publicly shared after meetings, as a GitHub issue ([example](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/issues/1629)) and/or public Google Doc

**Examples**:

* Security in MCP
* Auth in MCP
* Using MCP in enterprise settings
* Tooling and practices surrounding hosting MCP servers
* Tooling and practices surrounding implementing MCP clients

**Lifecycle**:

* Creation begins by filling out a template in the #wg-ig-group-creation [Discord](/community/communication#discord) channel
* A community moderator will review and call for a vote in the (private) #community-moderators Discord channel. Majority positive vote by members over a 72h period approves creation of the group.
  * The creation of the group can be reversed at any time (e.g., after new information surfaces). Core and lead maintainers can veto.
* Facilitator(s) and Maintainer(s) responsible for organizing IG into meeting expectations
  * Facilitator is an informal role responsible for shepherding or speaking for a group
  * Maintainer is an official representative from the MCP steering group. A maintainer is not required for every group, but can help advocate for specific changes or initiatives.
* IG is retired only when community moderators or Core or Lead Maintainers determine it's no longer active and/or needed
  * Successful IGs do not have a time limit or expiration date - as long as they are active and maintained, they will remain available

**Creation Template**:

* Facilitator(s)
* Maintainer(s) (optional)
* IGs with potentially similar goals/discussions
* How this IG differentiates itself from the related IGs
* First topic you to discuss within the IG

Participation in an Interest Group (IG) is not required to start a Working Group (WG) or to create a SEP. However, building consensus within IGs can be valuable when justifying the formation of a WG. Likewise, referencing support from IGs or WGs can strengthen a SEP and its chances of success.

### Working Groups (WG)

**Goal:** Facilitate collaboration within the MCP community on a SEP, a themed series of SEPs, or an otherwise officially endorsed project.

**Expectations**:

* Meaningful progress towards at least one SEP or spec-related implementation **OR** hold maintenance responsibilities for a project (e.g., Inspector, Registry, SDKs)
* Facilitators are responsible for keeping track of progress and communicating status when appropriate
* Meeting dates and times published in advance on the [MCP community calendar](https://meet.modelcontextprotocol.io/) when applicable, and tagged with their primary topic and working group Discord channel name (e.g. `agents-wg`)
* Notes publicly shared after meetings, as a GitHub issue ([example](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/issues/1629)) and/or public Google Doc

**Examples**:

* Registry
* Inspector
* Tool Filtering
* Server Identity

**Lifecycle**:

* Creation begins by filling out a template in #wg-ig-group-creation Discord channel
* A community moderator will review and call for a vote in the (private) #community-moderators Discord channel. Majority positive vote by members over a 72h period approves creation of the group.
  * The creation of the group can be reversed at any time (e.g., after new information surfaces). Core and lead maintainers can veto.
* Facilitator(s) and Maintainer(s) responsible for organizing WG into meeting expectations
  * Facilitator is an informal role responsible for shepherding or speaking for a group
  * Maintainer is an official representative from the MCP steering group. A maintainer is not required for every group, but can help advocate for specific changes or initiatives
* WG is retired when either:
  * Community moderators or Core and Lead Maintainers decide it is no longer active and/or needed
  * The WG no longer has an active Issue/PR for a month or more, or has completed all Issues/PRs it intended to pursue.

**Creation Template**:

* Facilitator(s)
* Maintainer(s) (optional)
* Explanation of interest/use cases, ideally originating from an IG discussion; however that is not a requirement
* First Issue/PR/SEP that the WG will work on
