## Example


### Data Layer

This section provides a step-by-step walkthrough of an MCP client-server interaction, focusing on the data layer protocol. We'll demonstrate the lifecycle sequence, tool operations, and notifications using JSON-RPC 2.0 messages.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Initialization (Lifecycle Management)">
    MCP begins with lifecycle management through a capability negotiation handshake. As described in the [lifecycle management](#lifecycle-management) section, the client sends an `initialize` request to establish the connection and negotiate supported features.

    <CodeGroup>
      ```json Initialize Request theme={null}
      {
        "jsonrpc": "2.0",
        "id": 1,
        "method": "initialize",
        "params": {
          "protocolVersion": "2025-06-18",
          "capabilities": {
            "elicitation": {}
          },
          "clientInfo": {
            "name": "example-client",
            "version": "1.0.0"
          }
        }
      }
      ```

      ```json Initialize Response theme={null}
      {
        "jsonrpc": "2.0",
        "id": 1,
        "result": {
          "protocolVersion": "2025-06-18",
          "capabilities": {
            "tools": {
              "listChanged": true
            },
            "resources": {}
          },
          "serverInfo": {
            "name": "example-server",
            "version": "1.0.0"
          }
        }
      }
      ```
    </CodeGroup>

    #### Understanding the Initialization Exchange

    The initialization process is a key part of MCP's lifecycle management and serves several critical purposes:

    1. **Protocol Version Negotiation**: The `protocolVersion` field (e.g., "2025-06-18") ensures both client and server are using compatible protocol versions. This prevents communication errors that could occur when different versions attempt to interact. If a mutually compatible version is not negotiated, the connection should be terminated.

    2. **Capability Discovery**: The `capabilities` object allows each party to declare what features they support, including which [primitives](#primitives) they can handle (tools, resources, prompts) and whether they support features like [notifications](#notifications). This enables efficient communication by avoiding unsupported operations.

    3. **Identity Exchange**: The `clientInfo` and `serverInfo` objects provide identification and versioning information for debugging and compatibility purposes.

    In this example, the capability negotiation demonstrates how MCP primitives are declared:

    **Client Capabilities**:

    * `"elicitation": {}` - The client declares it can work with user interaction requests (can receive `elicitation/create` method calls)

    **Server Capabilities**:

    * `"tools": {"listChanged": true}` - The server supports the tools primitive AND can send `tools/list_changed` notifications when its tool list changes
    * `"resources": {}` - The server also supports the resources primitive (can handle `resources/list` and `resources/read` methods)

    After successful initialization, the client sends a notification to indicate it's ready:

    ```json Notification theme={null}
    {
      "jsonrpc": "2.0",
      "method": "notifications/initialized"
    }
    ```

    #### How This Works in AI Applications

    During initialization, the AI application's MCP client manager establishes connections to configured servers and stores their capabilities for later use. The application uses this information to determine which servers can provide specific types of functionality (tools, resources, prompts) and whether they support real-time updates.

    ```python Pseudo-code for AI application initialization theme={null}
    # Pseudo Code
    async with stdio_client(server_config) as (read, write):
        async with ClientSession(read, write) as session:
            init_response = await session.initialize()
            if init_response.capabilities.tools:
                app.register_mcp_server(session, supports_tools=True)
            app.set_server_ready(session)
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Tool Discovery (Primitives)">
    Now that the connection is established, the client can discover available tools by sending a `tools/list` request. This request is fundamental to MCP's tool discovery mechanism — it allows clients to understand what tools are available on the server before attempting to use them.

    <CodeGroup>
      ```json Tools List Request theme={null}
      {
        "jsonrpc": "2.0",
        "id": 2,
        "method": "tools/list"
      }
      ```

      ```json Tools List Response theme={null}
      {
        "jsonrpc": "2.0",
        "id": 2,
        "result": {
          "tools": [
            {
              "name": "calculator_arithmetic",
              "title": "Calculator",
              "description": "Perform mathematical calculations including basic arithmetic, trigonometric functions, and algebraic operations",
              "inputSchema": {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                  "expression": {
                    "type": "string",
                    "description": "Mathematical expression to evaluate (e.g., '2 + 3 * 4', 'sin(30)', 'sqrt(16)')"
                  }
                },
                "required": ["expression"]
              }
            },
            {
              "name": "weather_current",
              "title": "Weather Information",
              "description": "Get current weather information for any location worldwide",
              "inputSchema": {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                  "location": {
                    "type": "string",
                    "description": "City name, address, or coordinates (latitude,longitude)"
                  },
                  "units": {
                    "type": "string",
                    "enum": ["metric", "imperial", "kelvin"],
                    "description": "Temperature units to use in response",
                    "default": "metric"
                  }
                },
                "required": ["location"]
              }
            }
          ]
        }
      }
      ```
    </CodeGroup>

    #### Understanding the Tool Discovery Request

    The `tools/list` request is simple, containing no parameters.

    #### Understanding the Tool Discovery Response

    The response contains a `tools` array that provides comprehensive metadata about each available tool. This array-based structure allows servers to expose multiple tools simultaneously while maintaining clear boundaries between different functionalities.

    Each tool object in the response includes several key fields:

    * **`name`**: A unique identifier for the tool within the server's namespace. This serves as the primary key for tool execution and should follow a clear naming pattern (e.g., `calculator_arithmetic` rather than just `calculate`)
    * **`title`**: A human-readable display name for the tool that clients can show to users
    * **`description`**: Detailed explanation of what the tool does and when to use it
    * **`inputSchema`**: A JSON Schema that defines the expected input parameters, enabling type validation and providing clear documentation about required and optional parameters

    #### How This Works in AI Applications

    The AI application fetches available tools from all connected MCP servers and combines them into a unified tool registry that the language model can access. This allows the LLM to understand what actions it can perform and automatically generates the appropriate tool calls during conversations.

    ```python Pseudo-code for AI application tool discovery theme={null}
    # Pseudo-code using MCP Python SDK patterns
    available_tools = []
    for session in app.mcp_server_sessions():
        tools_response = await session.list_tools()
        available_tools.extend(tools_response.tools)
    conversation.register_available_tools(available_tools)
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Tool Execution (Primitives)">
    The client can now execute a tool using the `tools/call` method. This demonstrates how MCP primitives are used in practice: after discovering available tools, the client can invoke them with appropriate arguments.

    #### Understanding the Tool Execution Request

    The `tools/call` request follows a structured format that ensures type safety and clear communication between client and server. Note that we're using the proper tool name from the discovery response (`weather_current`) rather than a simplified name:

    <CodeGroup>
      ```json Tool Call Request theme={null}
      {
        "jsonrpc": "2.0",
        "id": 3,
        "method": "tools/call",
        "params": {
          "name": "weather_current",
          "arguments": {
            "location": "San Francisco",
            "units": "imperial"
          }
        }
      }
      ```

      ```json Tool Call Response theme={null}
      {
        "jsonrpc": "2.0",
        "id": 3,
        "result": {
          "content": [
            {
              "type": "text",
              "text": "Current weather in San Francisco: 68°F, partly cloudy with light winds from the west at 8 mph. Humidity: 65%"
            }
          ]
        }
      }
      ```
    </CodeGroup>

    #### Key Elements of Tool Execution

    The request structure includes several important components:

    1. **`name`**: Must match exactly the tool name from the discovery response (`weather_current`). This ensures the server can correctly identify which tool to execute.

    2. **`arguments`**: Contains the input parameters as defined by the tool's `inputSchema`. In this example:
       * `location`: "San Francisco" (required parameter)
       * `units`: "imperial" (optional parameter, defaults to "metric" if not specified)

    3. **JSON-RPC Structure**: Uses standard JSON-RPC 2.0 format with unique `id` for request-response correlation.

    #### Understanding the Tool Execution Response

    The response demonstrates MCP's flexible content system:

    1. **`content` Array**: Tool responses return an array of content objects, allowing for rich, multi-format responses (text, images, resources, etc.)

    2. **Content Types**: Each content object has a `type` field. In this example, `"type": "text"` indicates plain text content, but MCP supports various content types for different use cases.

    3. **Structured Output**: The response provides actionable information that the AI application can use as context for language model interactions.

    This execution pattern allows AI applications to dynamically invoke server functionality and receive structured responses that can be integrated into conversations with language models.

    #### How This Works in AI Applications

    When the language model decides to use a tool during a conversation, the AI application intercepts the tool call, routes it to the appropriate MCP server, executes it, and returns the results back to the LLM as part of the conversation flow. This enables the LLM to access real-time data and perform actions in the external world.

    ```python  theme={null}
    # Pseudo-code for AI application tool execution
    async def handle_tool_call(conversation, tool_name, arguments):
        session = app.find_mcp_session_for_tool(tool_name)
        result = await session.call_tool(tool_name, arguments)
        conversation.add_tool_result(result.content)
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Real-time Updates (Notifications)">
    MCP supports real-time notifications that enable servers to inform clients about changes without being explicitly requested. This demonstrates the notification system, a key feature that keeps MCP connections synchronized and responsive.

    #### Understanding Tool List Change Notifications

    When the server's available tools change—such as when new functionality becomes available, existing tools are modified, or tools become temporarily unavailable—the server can proactively notify connected clients:

    ```json Request theme={null}
    {
      "jsonrpc": "2.0",
      "method": "notifications/tools/list_changed"
    }
    ```

    #### Key Features of MCP Notifications

    1. **No Response Required**: Notice there's no `id` field in the notification. This follows JSON-RPC 2.0 notification semantics where no response is expected or sent.

    2. **Capability-Based**: This notification is only sent by servers that declared `"listChanged": true` in their tools capability during initialization (as shown in Step 1).

    3. **Event-Driven**: The server decides when to send notifications based on internal state changes, making MCP connections dynamic and responsive.

    #### Client Response to Notifications

    Upon receiving this notification, the client typically reacts by requesting the updated tool list. This creates a refresh cycle that keeps the client's understanding of available tools current:

    ```json Request theme={null}
    {
      "jsonrpc": "2.0",
      "id": 4,
      "method": "tools/list"
    }
    ```

    #### Why Notifications Matter

    This notification system is crucial for several reasons:

    1. **Dynamic Environments**: Tools may come and go based on server state, external dependencies, or user permissions
    2. **Efficiency**: Clients don't need to poll for changes; they're notified when updates occur
    3. **Consistency**: Ensures clients always have accurate information about available server capabilities
    4. **Real-time Collaboration**: Enables responsive AI applications that can adapt to changing contexts

    This notification pattern extends beyond tools to other MCP primitives, enabling comprehensive real-time synchronization between clients and servers.

    #### How This Works in AI Applications

    When the AI application receives a notification about changed tools, it immediately refreshes its tool registry and updates the LLM's available capabilities. This ensures that ongoing conversations always have access to the most current set of tools, and the LLM can dynamically adapt to new functionality as it becomes available.

    ```python  theme={null}
    # Pseudo-code for AI application notification handling
    async def handle_tools_changed_notification(session):
        tools_response = await session.list_tools()
        app.update_available_tools(session, tools_response.tools)
        if app.conversation.is_active():
            app.conversation.notify_llm_of_new_capabilities()
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
