<Info>**Protocol Revision**: 2025-06-18</Info>

The Model Context Protocol consists of several key components that work together:

* **Base Protocol**: Core JSON-RPC message types
* **Lifecycle Management**: Connection initialization, capability negotiation, and
  session control
* **Authorization**: Authentication and authorization framework for HTTP-based transports
* **Server Features**: Resources, prompts, and tools exposed by servers
* **Client Features**: Sampling and root directory lists provided by clients
* **Utilities**: Cross-cutting concerns like logging and argument completion

All implementations **MUST** support the base protocol and lifecycle management
components. Other components **MAY** be implemented based on the specific needs of the
application.

These protocol layers establish clear separation of concerns while enabling rich
interactions between clients and servers. The modular design allows implementations to
support exactly the features they need.
