## WG/IG Facilitators


A **Facilitator** role in a WG or IG does *not* result in a [maintainership role](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/blob/main/MAINTAINERS.md) across the MCP organization. It is an informal role into which anyone can self-nominate.

A Facilitator is responsible for helping shepherd discussions and collaboration within an Interest or Working Group.

Lead and Core Maintainers reserve the right to modify the list of Facilitators and Maintainers for any WG/IG at any time.
