# Working and Interest Groups


Source: https://modelcontextprotocol.io/community/working-interest-groups

Learn about the two forms of collaborative groups within the Model Context Protocol's governance structure - Working Groups and Interest Groups.

Within the MCP contributor community we maintain two types of collaboration formats - **Interest** and **Working** groups.

**Interest Groups** are responsible for identifying and articulating problems that MCP should address, primarily by facilitating open discussions within the community. In contrast, **Working Groups** focus on developing concrete solutions by collaboratively producing deliverables, such as SEPs or community-owned implementations of the specification.

While input from Interest Groups can help justify the formation of a Working Group, it is not a strict requirement. Similarly, contributions from either Interest Groups or Working Groups are encouraged, but not mandatory, when submitting SEPs or other community proposals.

We strongly encourage all contributors interested in working on a specific SEP to first collaborate within an Interest Group. This collaborative process helps ensure that the proposed SEP aligns with community needs and is the right direction for the protocol.

Long-term projects in the MCP ecosystem, such as SDKs, Inspector, or Registry are maintained by dedicated Working Groups.
