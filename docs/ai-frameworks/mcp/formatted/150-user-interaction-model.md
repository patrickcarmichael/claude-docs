## User Interaction Model


Sampling in MCP allows servers to implement agentic behaviors, by enabling LLM calls to
occur *nested* inside other MCP server features.

Implementations are free to expose sampling through any interface pattern that suits
their needs—the protocol itself does not mandate any specific user interaction
model.

<Warning>
  For trust & safety and security, there **SHOULD** always
  be a human in the loop with the ability to deny sampling requests.

  Applications **SHOULD**:

  * Provide UI that makes it easy and intuitive to review sampling requests
  * Allow users to view and edit prompts before sending
  * Present generated responses for review before delivery
</Warning>
