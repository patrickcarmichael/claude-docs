## Purpose


These groups exist to:

* **Facilitate high-signal spaces for focused discussions** - contributors who opt into notifications, expertise sharing, and regular meetings can engage with topics that are highly relevant to them, enabling meaningful contributions and opportunities to learn from others.
* **Establish clear expectations and leadership roles** - guide collaborative efforts and ensure steady progress toward concrete deliverables that advance MCP evolution and adoption.
