## Schema


The full specification of the protocol is defined as a
[TypeScript schema](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/specification/blob/main/schema/2025-06-18/schema.ts).
This is the source of truth for all protocol messages and structures.

There is also a
[JSON Schema](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/specification/blob/main/schema/2025-06-18/schema.json),
which is automatically generated from the TypeScript source of truth, for use with
various automated tooling.

### General fields

#### `_meta`

The `_meta` property/parameter is reserved by MCP to allow clients and servers
to attach additional metadata to their interactions.

Certain key names are reserved by MCP for protocol-level metadata, as specified below;
implementations MUST NOT make assumptions about values at these keys.

Additionally, definitions in the [schema](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/specification/blob/main/schema/2025-06-18/schema.ts)
may reserve particular names for purpose-specific metadata, as declared in those definitions.

**Key name format:** valid `_meta` key names have two segments: an optional **prefix**, and a **name**.

**Prefix:**

* If specified, MUST be a series of labels separated by dots (`.`), followed by a slash (`/`).
  * Labels MUST start with a letter and end with a letter or digit; interior characters can be letters, digits, or hyphens (`-`).
* Any prefix beginning with zero or more valid labels, followed by `modelcontextprotocol` or `mcp`, followed by any valid label,
  is **reserved** for MCP use.
  * For example: `modelcontextprotocol.io/`, `mcp.dev/`, `api.modelcontextprotocol.org/`, and `tools.mcp.com/` are all reserved.

**Name:**

* Unless empty, MUST begin and end with an alphanumeric character (`[a-z0-9A-Z]`).
* MAY contain hyphens (`-`), underscores (`_`), dots (`.`), and alphanumerics in between.
