## Bringing Servers Together


The real power of MCP emerges when multiple servers work together, combining their specialized capabilities through a unified interface.

### Example: Multi-Server Travel Planning

Consider a personalized AI travel planner application, with three connected servers:

* **Travel Server** - Handles flights, hotels, and itineraries
* **Weather Server** - Provides climate data and forecasts
* **Calendar/Email Server** - Manages schedules and communications

#### The Complete Flow

1. **User invokes a prompt with parameters:**

   ```json  theme={null}
   {
     "prompt": "plan-vacation",
     "arguments": {
       "destination": "Barcelona",
       "departure_date": "2024-06-15",
       "return_date": "2024-06-22",
       "budget": 3000,
       "travelers": 2
     }
   }
   ```

2. **User selects resources to include:**
   * `calendar://my-calendar/June-2024` (from Calendar Server)
   * `travel://preferences/europe` (from Travel Server)
   * `travel://past-trips/Spain-2023` (from Travel Server)

3. **AI processes the request using tools:**

   The AI first reads all selected resources to gather context - identifying available dates from the calendar, learning preferred airlines and hotel types from travel preferences, and discovering previously enjoyed locations from past trips.

   Using this context, the AI then executes a series of Tools:

   * `searchFlights()` - Queries airlines for NYC to Barcelona flights
   * `checkWeather()` - Retrieves climate forecasts for travel dates

   The AI then uses this information to create the booking and following steps, requesting approval from the user where necessary:

   * `bookHotel()` - Finds hotels within the specified budget
   * `createCalendarEvent()` - Adds the trip to the user's calendar
   * `sendEmail()` - Sends confirmation with trip details

**The result:** Through multiple MCP servers, the user researched and booked a Barcelona trip tailored to their schedule. The "Plan a Vacation" prompt guided the AI to combine Resources (calendar availability and travel history) with Tools (searching flights, booking hotels, updating calendars) across different servers—gathering context and executing the booking. A task that could've taken hours was completed in minutes using MCP.
