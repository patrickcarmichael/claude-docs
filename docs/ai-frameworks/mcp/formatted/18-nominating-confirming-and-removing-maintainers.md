## Nominating, Confirming and Removing Maintainers


### The Principles

* Membership in module maintainer groups is given to **individuals** on merit basis after they demonstrated strong expertise of their area of work through contributions, reviews, and discussions and are aligned with the overall MCP direction.
* For membership in the **maintainer** group the individual has to demonstrate strong and continued alignment with the overall MCP principles.
* No term limits for module maintainers or core maintainers
* Light criteria of moving working-group or sub-project maintenance to 'emeritus' status if they don't actively participate over long periods of time. Each maintainer group may define the inactive period that's appropriate for their area.
* The membership is for an individual, not a company.

### Nomination and Removal

* Core Maintainers are responsible for adding and removing maintainers. They will take the consideration of existing maintainers into account.
* The lead maintainers are responsible for adding and removing core maintainers.

#### Nomination Process

If a Maintainer (or Core / Lead Maintainer) wishes to propose a nomination for the Core / Lead Maintainers’ consideration, they should follow the following process:

1. Collect evidence for the nomination. This will generally come in the form of a history of merged PRs on the repositories for which maintainership is being considered.
2. Discuss among maintainers of the relevant group(s) as to whether they would be supportive of approving the nomination.
3. DM a Community Moderator or Core Maintainer to create a private channel in Discord, in the format `nomination-{name}-{group}`. Add all core maintainers, lead maintainers, and co-maintainers on the relevant group.
4. Provide context for the individual under nomination. See below for suggestions on what to include here.
5. Create a Discord Poll and ask Core / Lead Maintainers to vote Yes / No on the nomination. Reaching consensus is encouraged though not required.
6. After Core / Lead Maintainers discuss and/or vote, if the nomination is favorable, relevant members with permissions to update GitHub an Discord roles will add the nominee to the appropriate groups. The nominator should announce the new maintainership in the relevant Discord channel.
7. The temporary Discord channel will be deleted a week later.

Suggestions for the kind of information to share with core maintainers when nominating someone:

* GitHub profile link, LinkedIn profile link, Discord username
* For what group(s) are you nominating the individual for maintainership
* Whether the group(s) agree that this person should be elevated to maintainership
* Description of their contributions to date (including links to most substantial contributions)
* Description of expected contributions moving forward (e.g. Are they eager to be a maintainer? Will they have capacity to do so?)
* Other context about the individual (e.g. current employer, motivations behind MCP involvement)
* Anything else you think may be relevant to consider for the nomination
