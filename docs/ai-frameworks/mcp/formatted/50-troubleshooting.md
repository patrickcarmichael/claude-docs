## Troubleshooting


If you encounter issues setting up or using the Filesystem Server, these solutions address common problems:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Server not showing up in Claude / hammer icon missing">
    1. Restart Claude Desktop completely
    2. Check your `claude_desktop_config.json` file syntax
    3. Make sure the file paths included in `claude_desktop_config.json` are valid and that they are absolute and not relative
    4. Look at [logs](#getting-logs-from-claude-for-desktop) to see why the server is not connecting
    5. In your command line, try manually running the server (replacing `username` as you did in `claude_desktop_config.json`) to see if you get any errors:

    <CodeGroup>
      ```bash macOS/Linux theme={null}
      npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem /Users/username/Desktop /Users/username/Downloads
      ```

      ```powershell Windows theme={null}
      npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem C:\Users\username\Desktop C:\Users\username\Downloads
      ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Getting logs from Claude Desktop">
    Claude.app logging related to MCP is written to log files in:

    * macOS: `~/Library/Logs/Claude`

    * Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\logs`

    * `mcp.log` will contain general logging about MCP connections and connection failures.

    * Files named `mcp-server-SERVERNAME.log` will contain error (stderr) logging from the named server.

    You can run the following command to list recent logs and follow along with any new ones (on Windows, it will only show recent logs):

    <CodeGroup>
      ```bash macOS/Linux theme={null}
      tail -n 20 -f ~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp*.log
      ```

      ```powershell Windows theme={null}
      type "%APPDATA%\Claude\logs\mcp*.log"
      ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Tool calls failing silently">
    If Claude attempts to use the tools but they fail:

    1. Check Claude's logs for errors
    2. Verify your server builds and runs without errors
    3. Try restarting Claude Desktop
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="None of this is working. What do I do?">
    Please refer to our [debugging guide](/legacy/tools/debugging) for better debugging tools and more detailed guidance.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="ENOENT error and `${APPDATA}` in paths on Windows">
    If your configured server fails to load, and you see within its logs an error referring to `${APPDATA}` within a path, you may need to add the expanded value of `%APPDATA%` to your `env` key in `claude_desktop_config.json`:

    ```json  theme={null}
    {
      "brave-search": {
        "command": "npx",
        "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-brave-search"],
        "env": {
          "APPDATA": "C:\\Users\\user\\AppData\\Roaming\\",
          "BRAVE_API_KEY": "..."
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    With this change in place, launch Claude Desktop once again.

    <Warning>
      **npm should be installed globally**

      The `npx` command may continue to fail if you have not installed npm globally. If npm is already installed globally, you will find `%APPDATA%\npm` exists on your system. If not, you can install npm globally by running the following command:

      ```bash  theme={null}
      npm install -g npm
      ```
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
