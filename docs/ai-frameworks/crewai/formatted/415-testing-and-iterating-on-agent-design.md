## Testing and Iterating on Agent Design


Agent design is often an iterative process. Here's a practical approach:

1. **Start with a prototype**: Create an initial agent definition
2. **Test with sample tasks**: Evaluate performance on representative tasks
3. **Analyze outputs**: Identify strengths and weaknesses
4. **Refine the definition**: Adjust role, goal, and backstory based on observations
5. **Test in collaboration**: Evaluate how the agent performs in a crew setting
