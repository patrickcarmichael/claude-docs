## Best Practices for Sequential Processes


1. **Order Matters**: Arrange tasks in a logical sequence where each task builds upon the previous one.
2. **Clear Task Descriptions**: Provide detailed descriptions for each task to guide the agents effectively.
3. **Appropriate Agent Selection**: Match agents' skills and roles to the requirements of each task.
4. **Use Context**: Leverage the context from previous tasks to inform subsequent ones.

This updated documentation ensures that details accurately reflect the latest changes in the codebase and clearly describes how to leverage new features and configurations.
The content is kept simple and direct to ensure easy understanding.
