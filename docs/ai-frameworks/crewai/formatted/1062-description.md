## Description


The CodeDocsSearchTool is a powerful RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) tool designed for semantic searches within code documentation.
It enables users to efficiently find specific information or topics within code documentation. By providing a `docs_url` during initialization,
the tool narrows down the search to that particular documentation site. Alternatively, without a specific `docs_url`,
it searches across a wide array of code documentation known or discovered throughout its execution, making it versatile for various documentation search needs.
