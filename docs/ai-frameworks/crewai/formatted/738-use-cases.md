* Leverage existing knowledge repositories that are already maintained in your AWS environment
* Combine CrewAI's reasoning with domain-specific information from your knowledge bases

### Data-Driven Decision Making

* Ensure agents provide recommendations based on your specific business context and documentation
* Reduce hallucinations by retrieving factual information from your knowledge bases

### Scalable Information Access
