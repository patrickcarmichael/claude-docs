## Sequential Process Overview


The sequential process ensures tasks are executed one after the other, following a linear progression.
This approach is ideal for projects requiring tasks to be completed in a specific order.

### Key Features

* **Linear Task Flow**: Ensures orderly progression by handling tasks in a predetermined sequence.
* **Simplicity**: Best suited for projects with clear, step-by-step tasks.
* **Easy Monitoring**: Facilitates easy tracking of task completion and project progress.
