## What are LLMs?


Large Language Models (LLMs) are the core intelligence behind CrewAI agents. They enable agents to understand context, make decisions, and generate human-like responses. Here's what you need to know:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="LLM Basics" icon="brain">
    Large Language Models are AI systems trained on vast amounts of text data. They power the intelligence of your CrewAI agents, enabling them to understand and generate human-like text.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Context Window" icon="window">
    The context window determines how much text an LLM can process at once. Larger windows (e.g., 128K tokens) allow for more context but may be more expensive and slower.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Temperature" icon="temperature-three-quarters">
    Temperature (0.0 to 1.0) controls response randomness. Lower values (e.g., 0.2) produce more focused, deterministic outputs, while higher values (e.g., 0.8) increase creativity and variability.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Provider Selection" icon="server">
    Each LLM provider (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) offers different models with varying capabilities, pricing, and features. Choose based on your needs for accuracy, speed, and cost.
  </Card>
