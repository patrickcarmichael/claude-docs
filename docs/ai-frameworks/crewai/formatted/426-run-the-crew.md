### When to Choose Flows

Flows are ideal when:

1. **You need precise control over execution** - The workflow requires exact sequencing and state management
2. **The application has complex state requirements** - You need to maintain and transform state across multiple steps
3. **You need structured, predictable outputs** - The application requires consistent, formatted results
4. **The workflow involves conditional logic** - Different paths need to be taken based on intermediate results
5. **You need to combine AI with procedural code** - The solution requires both AI capabilities and traditional programming

```python  theme={null}
