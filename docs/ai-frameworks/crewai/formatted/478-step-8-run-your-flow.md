## Step 8: Run Your Flow


Now it's time to see your flow in action! Run it using the CrewAI CLI:

```bash  theme={null}
crewai flow kickoff
```

When you run this command, you'll see your flow spring to life:

1. It will prompt you for a topic and audience level
2. It will create a structured outline for your guide
3. It will process each section, with the content writer and reviewer collaborating on each
4. Finally, it will compile everything into a comprehensive guide

This demonstrates the power of flows to orchestrate complex processes involving multiple components, both AI and non-AI.
