## Use Cases


### Distributed Crew Orchestration

* Coordinate multiple specialized crew automations to handle complex, multi-stage workflows
* Enable seamless handoffs between different automation services for comprehensive task execution
* Scale processing by distributing workloads across multiple CrewAI Platform automations

### Cross-Platform Integration

* Bridge CrewAI agents with CrewAI Platform automations for hybrid local-cloud workflows
* Leverage specialized automations while maintaining local control and orchestration
* Enable secure collaboration between local agents and cloud-based automation services

### Enterprise Automation Pipelines

* Create enterprise-grade automation pipelines that combine local intelligence with cloud processing power
* Implement complex business workflows that span multiple automation services
* Enable scalable, repeatable processes for data analysis, reporting, and decision-making

### Dynamic Workflow Composition

* Dynamically compose workflows by chaining different automation services based on task requirements
* Enable adaptive processing where the choice of automation depends on data characteristics or business rules
* Create flexible, reusable automation components that can be combined in various ways

### Specialized Domain Processing

* Access domain-specific automations (financial analysis, legal research, technical documentation) from general-purpose agents
* Leverage pre-built, specialized crew automations without rebuilding complex domain logic
* Enable agents to access expert-level capabilities through targeted automation services
