## Overview


<Note>
  We are still working on improving tools, so there might be unexpected behavior or changes in the future.
</Note>

The FileReadTool conceptually represents a suite of functionalities within the crewai\_tools package aimed at facilitating file reading and content retrieval.
This suite includes tools for processing batch text files, reading runtime configuration files, and importing data for analytics.
It supports a variety of text-based file formats such as `.txt`, `.csv`, `.json`, and more. Depending on the file type, the suite offers specialized functionality,
such as converting JSON content into a Python dictionary for ease of use.
