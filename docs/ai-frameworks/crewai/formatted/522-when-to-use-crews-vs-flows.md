## When to Use Crews vs. Flows


<Note>
  Understanding when to use [Crews](/en/guides/crews/first-crew) versus [Flows](/en/guides/flows/first-flow) is key to maximizing the potential of CrewAI in your applications.
</Note>

| Use Case                | Recommended Approach                 | Why?                                                                                                                                        |
| :---------------------- | :----------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Open-ended research** | [Crews](/en/guides/crews/first-crew) | When tasks require creative thinking, exploration, and adaptation                                                                           |
| **Content generation**  | [Crews](/en/guides/crews/first-crew) | For collaborative creation of articles, reports, or marketing materials                                                                     |
| **Decision workflows**  | [Flows](/en/guides/flows/first-flow) | When you need predictable, auditable decision paths with precise control                                                                    |
| **API orchestration**   | [Flows](/en/guides/flows/first-flow) | For reliable integration with multiple external services in a specific sequence                                                             |
| **Hybrid applications** | Combined approach                    | Use [Flows](/en/guides/flows/first-flow) to orchestrate overall process with [Crews](/en/guides/crews/first-crew) handling complex subtasks |

### Decision Framework

* **Choose [Crews](/en/guides/crews/first-crew) when:** You need autonomous problem-solving, creative collaboration, or exploratory tasks
* **Choose [Flows](/en/guides/flows/first-flow) when:** You require deterministic outcomes, auditability, or precise control over execution
* **Combine both when:** Your application needs both structured processes and pockets of autonomous intelligence
