## Overview


Use the Microsoft Teams trigger to start automations whenever a new chat is created. Common patterns include summarizing inbound requests, routing urgent messages to support teams, or creating follow-up tasks in other systems.

<Tip>
  Confirm Microsoft Teams is connected under **Tools & Integrations** and enabled in the **Triggers** tab for your deployment.
