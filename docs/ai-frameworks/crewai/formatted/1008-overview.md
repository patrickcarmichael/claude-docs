## Overview


<Note>
  We are still working on improving tools, so there might be unexpected behavior or changes in the future.
</Note>

This tool is used to perform a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) search within the content of a text file.
It allows for semantic searching of a query within a specified text file's content,
making it an invaluable resource for quickly extracting information or finding specific sections of text based on the query provided.
