## What is a Tool?


A tool in CrewAI is a skill or function that agents can utilize to perform various actions.
This includes tools from the [CrewAI Toolkit](https://github.com/joaomdmoura/crewai-tools) and [LangChain Tools](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools),
enabling everything from simple searches to complex interactions and effective teamwork among agents.
