## Step 9: Run Your Crew


Now for the exciting moment - it's time to run your crew and see AI collaboration in action!

```bash  theme={null}
crewai run
```

When you run this command, you'll see your crew spring to life. The researcher will gather information about the specified topic, and the analyst will then create a comprehensive report based on that research. You'll see the agents' thought processes, actions, and outputs in real-time as they work together to complete their tasks.
