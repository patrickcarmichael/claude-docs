## Description


The PGSearchTool is envisioned as a powerful tool for facilitating semantic searches within PostgreSQL database tables. By leveraging advanced Retrieve and Generate (RAG) technology,
it aims to provide an efficient means for querying database table content, specifically tailored for PostgreSQL databases.
The tool's goal is to simplify the process of finding relevant data through semantic search queries, offering a valuable resource for users needing to conduct advanced queries on
extensive datasets within a PostgreSQL environment.
