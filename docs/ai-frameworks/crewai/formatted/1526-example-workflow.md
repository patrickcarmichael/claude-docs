    Respond to clarifying questions from the Crew Assistant to refine your requirements.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review the Plan">
    Review the generated crew plan, which might include:

    * A Research Agent to gather financial news
    * An Analysis Agent to interpret the data
    * A Recommendations Agent to provide investment advice
  </Step>

  <Step title="Approve or Modify">
    Approve the plan or request changes if necessary.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Download or Deploy">
