# Verify connection

if langfuse.auth_check():
    print("Langfuse client is authenticated and ready!")
else:
    print("Authentication failed. Please check your credentials and host.")
```

### Step 3: Initialize OpenLit

Initialize the OpenLit OpenTelemetry instrumentation SDK to start capturing OpenTelemetry traces.

```python  theme={null}
import openlit

openlit.init()
```

### Step 4: Create a Simple CrewAI Application

We'll create a simple CrewAI application where multiple agents collaborate to answer a user's question.

```python  theme={null}
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew

from crewai_tools import (
    WebsiteSearchTool
)

web_rag_tool = WebsiteSearchTool()

writer = Agent(
        role="Writer",
        goal="You make math engaging and understandable for young children through poetry",
        backstory="You're an expert in writing haikus but you know nothing of math.",
        tools=[web_rag_tool],  
    )

task = Task(description=("What is {multiplication}?"),
            expected_output=("Compose a haiku that includes the answer."),
            agent=writer)

crew = Crew(
  agents=[writer],
  tasks=[task],
  share_crew=False
)
```

### Step 5: See Traces in Langfuse

After running the agent, you can view the traces generated by your CrewAI application in [Langfuse](https://cloud.langfuse.com). You should see detailed steps of the LLM interactions, which can help you debug and optimize your AI agent.
