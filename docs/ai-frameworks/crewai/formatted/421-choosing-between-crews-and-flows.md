## Choosing Between Crews and Flows


### When to Choose Crews

Crews are ideal when:

1. **You need collaborative intelligence** - Multiple agents with different specializations need to work together
2. **The problem requires emergent thinking** - The solution benefits from different perspectives and approaches
3. **The task is primarily creative or analytical** - The work involves research, content creation, or analysis
4. **You value adaptability over strict structure** - The workflow can benefit from agent autonomy
5. **The output format can be somewhat flexible** - Some variation in output structure is acceptable

```python  theme={null}
