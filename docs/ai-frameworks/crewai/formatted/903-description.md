## Description


This tool is used to perform a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) search within a CSV file's content. It allows users to semantically search for queries in the content of a specified CSV file.
This feature is particularly useful for extracting information from large CSV datasets where traditional search methods might be inefficient. All tools with "Search" in their name, including CSVSearchTool,
are RAG tools designed for searching different sources of data.
