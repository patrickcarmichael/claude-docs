## Installation


To use this tool, you need to install the Scrapegraph Python client:

```shell  theme={null}
uv add scrapegraph-py
```

You'll also need to set up your Scrapegraph API key as an environment variable:

```shell  theme={null}
export SCRAPEGRAPH_API_KEY="your_api_key"
```

You can obtain an API key from [Scrapegraph AI](https://scrapegraphai.com).
