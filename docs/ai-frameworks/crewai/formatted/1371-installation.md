## Installation


To use this tool, you need to install the CrewAI tools package and Selenium:

```shell  theme={null}
pip install 'crewai[tools]'
uv add selenium webdriver-manager
```

You'll also need to have Chrome installed on your system, as the tool uses Chrome WebDriver for browser automation.
