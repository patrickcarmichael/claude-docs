## Description


The XMLSearchTool is a cutting-edge RAG tool engineered for conducting semantic searches within XML files.
Ideal for users needing to parse and extract information from XML content efficiently, this tool supports inputting a search query and an optional XML file path.
By specifying an XML path, users can target their search more precisely to the content of that file, thereby obtaining more relevant search outcomes.
