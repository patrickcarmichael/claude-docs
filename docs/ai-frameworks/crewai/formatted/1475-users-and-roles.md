## Users and Roles


Each member in your CrewAI workspace is assigned a role, which determines their access across various features.

You can:

* Use predefined roles (Owner, Member)
* Create custom roles tailored to specific permissions
* Assign roles at any time through the settings panel

You can configure users and roles in Settings → Roles.

    Go to <b>Settings → Roles</b> in CrewAI AMP.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose a role type">
    Use a predefined role (<b>Owner</b>, <b>Member</b>) or click <b>Create role</b> to define a custom one.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Assign to members">
    Select users and assign the role. You can change this anytime.
  </Step>
