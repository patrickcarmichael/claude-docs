# Task 3

visualization_task:
  description: "Create a visual representation of the analyzed trends."
  expected_output: "A description of a chart showing trends and their impact ratings."
```

#### 2. Be Explicit About Inputs and Outputs

Always clearly specify what inputs the task will use and what the output should look like:

**Example:**

```yaml  theme={null}
analysis_task:
  description: >
    Analyze the customer feedback data from the CSV file.
    Focus on identifying recurring themes related to product usability.
    Consider sentiment and frequency when determining importance.
  expected_output: >
    A markdown report with the following sections:
    1. Executive summary (3-5 bullet points)
    2. Top 3 usability issues with supporting data
    3. Recommendations for improvement
```

#### 3. Include Purpose and Context

Explain why the task matters and how it fits into the larger workflow:

**Example:**

```yaml  theme={null}
competitor_analysis_task:
  description: >
    Analyze our three main competitors' pricing strategies.
    This analysis will inform our upcoming pricing model revision.
    Focus on identifying patterns in how they price premium features
    and how they structure their tiered offerings.
```

#### 4. Use Structured Output Tools

For machine-readable outputs, specify the format clearly:

**Example:**

```yaml  theme={null}
data_extraction_task:
  description: "Extract key metrics from the quarterly report."
  expected_output: "JSON object with the following keys: revenue, growth_rate, customer_acquisition_cost, and retention_rate."
```
