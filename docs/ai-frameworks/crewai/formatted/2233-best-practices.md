## Best Practices


### Development Phase

* Use detailed tracing to understand agent behavior
* Implement evaluation metrics early in development
* Monitor resource usage during testing
* Set up automated quality checks

### Production Phase

* Implement comprehensive monitoring and alerting
* Track performance trends over time
* Monitor for anomalies and degradation
* Maintain cost visibility and control

### Continuous Improvement

* Regular performance reviews and optimization
* A/B testing of different agent configurations
* Feedback loops for quality improvement
* Documentation of lessons learned

Choose the observability tools that best fit your use case, infrastructure, and monitoring requirements to ensure your CrewAI agents perform reliably and efficiently.
