## Using the `manager_agent` Attribute


### Custom Manager Agent

The `manager_agent` attribute allows you to define a custom agent to manage the crew. This agent will oversee the entire process, ensuring that tasks are completed efficiently and to the highest standard.

import os
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew, Process
