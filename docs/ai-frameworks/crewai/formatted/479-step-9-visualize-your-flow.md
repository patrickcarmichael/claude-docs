## Step 9: Visualize Your Flow


One of the powerful features of flows is the ability to visualize their structure:

```bash  theme={null}
crewai flow plot
```

This will create an HTML file that shows the structure of your flow, including the relationships between different steps and the data that flows between them. This visualization can be invaluable for understanding and debugging complex flows.
