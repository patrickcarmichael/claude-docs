## Overview


Use the Google Calendar trigger to launch automations whenever calendar events change. Common use cases include briefing a team before a meeting, notifying stakeholders when a critical event is cancelled, or summarizing daily schedules.

<Tip>
  Make sure Google Calendar is connected in **Tools & Integrations** and enabled for the deployment you want to automate.
