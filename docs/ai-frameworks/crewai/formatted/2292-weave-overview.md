# Weave Overview


[Weights & Biases (W\&B) Weave](https://weave-docs.wandb.ai/) is a framework for tracking, experimenting with, evaluating, deploying, and improving LLM-based applications.

Weave provides comprehensive support for every stage of your CrewAI application development:

* **Tracing & Monitoring**: Automatically track LLM calls and application logic to debug and analyze production systems
* **Systematic Iteration**: Refine and iterate on prompts, datasets, and models
* **Evaluation**: Use custom or pre-built scorers to systematically assess and enhance agent performance
* **Guardrails**: Protect your agents with pre- and post-safeguards for content moderation and prompt safety

Weave automatically captures traces for your CrewAI applications, enabling you to monitor and analyze your agents' performance, interactions, and execution flow. This helps you build better evaluation datasets and optimize your agent workflows.
