## Persisting Flow State


One of CrewAI's most powerful features is the ability to persist flow state across executions. This enables workflows that can be paused, resumed, and even recovered after failures.

### The @persist() Decorator

The `@persist()` decorator automates state persistence, saving your flow's state at key points in execution.

#### Class-Level Persistence

When applied at the class level, `@persist()` saves state after every method execution:

```python  theme={null}
from crewai.flow.flow import Flow, listen, start
from crewai.flow.persistence import persist
from pydantic import BaseModel

class CounterState(BaseModel):
    value: int = 0

@persist()  # Apply to the entire flow class
class PersistentCounterFlow(Flow[CounterState]):
    @start()
    def increment(self):
        self.state.value += 1
        print(f"Incremented to {self.state.value}")
        return self.state.value

    @listen(increment)
    def double(self, value):
        self.state.value = value * 2
        print(f"Doubled to {self.state.value}")
        return self.state.value
