## Description


The `RagTool` is designed to answer questions by leveraging the power of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) through CrewAI's native RAG system.
It provides a dynamic knowledge base that can be queried to retrieve relevant information from various data sources.
This tool is particularly useful for applications that require access to a vast array of information and need to provide contextually relevant answers.
