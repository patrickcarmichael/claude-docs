## Overview


Fingerprints in CrewAI provide a way to uniquely identify and track components throughout their lifecycle. Each `Agent`, `Crew`, and `Task` automatically receives a unique fingerprint when created, which cannot be manually overridden.

These fingerprints can be used for:

* Auditing and tracking component usage
* Ensuring component identity integrity
* Attaching metadata to components
* Creating a traceable chain of operations
