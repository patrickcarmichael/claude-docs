## Overview


Stagehand is a powerful browser automation framework built by Browserbase that allows AI agents to:

* Navigate to websites
* Click buttons, links, and other elements
* Fill in forms
* Extract data from web pages
* Observe and identify elements
* Perform complex workflows

The StagehandTool wraps the Stagehand Python SDK to provide CrewAI agents with browser control capabilities through three core primitives:

1. **Act**: Perform actions like clicking, typing, or navigating
2. **Extract**: Extract structured data from web pages
3. **Observe**: Identify and analyze elements on the page
