### Clearing Knowledge

If you need to clear the knowledge stored in CrewAI, you can use the `crewai reset-memories` command with the `--knowledge` option.

```bash Command theme={null}
crewai reset-memories --knowledge
```

This is useful when you've updated your knowledge sources and want to ensure that the agents are using the most recent information.
