## Connect CrewAI to LLMs


CrewAI uses LiteLLM to connect to a wide variety of Language Models (LLMs). This integration provides extensive versatility, allowing you to use models from numerous providers with a simple, unified interface.

<Note>
  By default, CrewAI uses the `gpt-4o-mini` model. This is determined by the `OPENAI_MODEL_NAME` environment variable, which defaults to "gpt-4o-mini" if not set.
  You can easily configure your agents to use a different model or provider as described in this guide.
</Note>
