## Quick Decision Framework


<Steps>
  <Step title="Analyze Your Tasks">
    Begin by deeply understanding what your tasks actually require. Consider the cognitive complexity involved, the depth of reasoning needed, the format of expected outputs, and the amount of context the model will need to process. This foundational analysis will guide every subsequent decision.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Map Model Capabilities">
    Once you understand your requirements, map them to model strengths. Different model families excel at different types of work; some are optimized for reasoning and analysis, others for creativity and content generation, and others for speed and efficiency.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Consider Constraints">
    Factor in your real-world operational constraints including budget limitations, latency requirements, data privacy needs, and infrastructure capabilities. The theoretically best model may not be the practically best choice for your situation.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test and Iterate">
    Start with reliable, well-understood models and optimize based on actual performance in your specific use case. Real-world results often differ from theoretical benchmarks, so empirical testing is crucial.
  </Step>
</Steps>
