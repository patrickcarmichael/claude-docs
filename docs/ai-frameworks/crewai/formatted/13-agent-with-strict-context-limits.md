# Agent with strict context limits

strict_agent = Agent(
    role="Legal Document Reviewer",
    goal="Provide precise legal analysis without information loss",
    backstory="Legal expert requiring complete context for accurate analysis",
    respect_context_window=False,  # ❌ Stop execution on context limit
    verbose=True
)
```

**What happens when context limits are exceeded:**

* ❌ **Error message**: `"Context length exceeded. Consider using smaller text or RAG tools from crewai_tools."`
* 🛑 **Execution stops**: Task execution halts immediately
* 🔧 **Manual intervention required**: You need to modify your approach

### Choosing the Right Setting

#### Use `respect_context_window=True` (Default) when:

* **Processing large documents** that might exceed context limits
* **Long-running conversations** where some summarization is acceptable
* **Research tasks** where general context is more important than exact details
* **Prototyping and development** where you want robust execution

```python Code theme={null}
