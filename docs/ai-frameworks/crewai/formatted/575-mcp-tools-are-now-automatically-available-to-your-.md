# MCP tools are now automatically available to your agent!

```

#### Structured Configurations (Full Control)

For complete control over connection settings, tool filtering, and all transport types:

```python  theme={null}
from crewai import Agent
from crewai.mcp import MCPServerStdio, MCPServerHTTP, MCPServerSSE
from crewai.mcp.filters import create_static_tool_filter

agent = Agent(
    role="Advanced Research Analyst",
    goal="Research with full control over MCP connections",
    backstory="Expert researcher with advanced tool access",
    mcps=[
        # Stdio transport for local servers
        MCPServerStdio(
            command="npx",
            args=["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem"],
            env={"API_KEY": "your_key"},
            tool_filter=create_static_tool_filter(
                allowed_tool_names=["read_file", "list_directory"]
            ),
            cache_tools_list=True,
        ),
        # HTTP/Streamable HTTP transport for remote servers
        MCPServerHTTP(
            url="https://api.example.com/mcp",
            headers={"Authorization": "Bearer your_token"},
            streamable=True,
            cache_tools_list=True,
        ),
        # SSE transport for real-time streaming
        MCPServerSSE(
            url="https://stream.example.com/mcp/sse",
            headers={"Authorization": "Bearer your_token"},
        ),
    ]
)
```

### 🔧 **Advanced: MCPServerAdapter** (For Complex Scenarios)

For advanced use cases requiring manual connection management, the `crewai-tools` library provides the `MCPServerAdapter` class.

We currently support the following transport mechanisms:

* **Stdio**: for local servers (communication via standard input/output between processes on the same machine)
* **Server-Sent Events (SSE)**: for remote servers (unidirectional, real-time data streaming from server to client over HTTP)
* **Streamable HTTPS**: for remote servers (flexible, potentially bi-directional communication over HTTPS, often utilizing SSE for server-to-client streams)
