## Advanced Customization Options


Beyond the basic attributes, CrewAI allows for deeper customization to enhance an agent's behavior and capabilities significantly.

### Language Model Customization

Agents can be customized with specific language models (`llm`) and function-calling language models (`function_calling_llm`), offering advanced control over their processing and decision-making abilities.
It's important to note that setting the `function_calling_llm` allows for overriding the default crew function-calling language model, providing a greater degree of customization.
