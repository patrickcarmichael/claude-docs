## Description


The `FileWriterTool` is a component of the crewai\_tools package, designed to simplify the process of writing content to files with cross-platform compatibility (Windows, Linux, macOS).
It is particularly useful in scenarios such as generating reports, saving logs, creating configuration files, and more.
This tool handles path differences across operating systems, supports UTF-8 encoding, and automatically creates directories if they don't exist, making it easier to organize your output reliably across different platforms.
