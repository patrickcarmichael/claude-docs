## Step 10: Review the Output


Once the flow completes, you'll find two files in the `output` directory:

1. `guide_outline.json`: Contains the structured outline of the guide
2. `complete_guide.md`: The comprehensive guide with all sections

Take a moment to review these files and appreciate what you've built - a system that combines user input, direct AI interactions, and collaborative agent work to produce a complex, high-quality output.
