## Conclusion


The `WeaviateVectorSearchTool` provides a powerful way to search for semantically similar documents in a Weaviate vector database. By leveraging vector embeddings, it enables more accurate and contextually relevant search results compared to traditional keyword-based searches. This tool is particularly useful for applications that require finding information based on meaning rather than exact matches.
