## Installation


To prepare your environment for when the WebsiteSearchTool becomes available, you can install the foundational package with:

```shell  theme={null}
pip install 'crewai[tools]'
```

This command installs the necessary dependencies to ensure that once the tool is fully integrated, users can start using it immediately.
