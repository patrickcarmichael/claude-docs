## Overview


`MCPServerAdapter` in `crewai-tools` allows you to connect to multiple MCP servers concurrently. This is useful when your agents need to access tools distributed across different services or environments. The adapter aggregates tools from all specified servers, making them available to your CrewAI agents.
