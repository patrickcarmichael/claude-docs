## After Updating


After performing any update:

1. The system will rebuild and redeploy your crew
2. You can monitor the deployment progress in real-time
3. Once complete, test your crew to ensure the changes are working as expected

<Tip>
  If you encounter any issues after updating, you can view deployment logs in the platform or contact support for assistance.
