## The 80/20 Rule: Focus on Tasks Over Agents


When building effective AI systems, remember this crucial principle: **80% of your effort should go into designing tasks, and only 20% into defining agents**.

Why? Because even the most perfectly defined agent will fail with poorly designed tasks, but well-designed tasks can elevate even a simple agent. This means:

* Spend most of your time writing clear task instructions
* Define detailed inputs and expected outputs
* Add examples and context to guide execution
* Dedicate the remaining time to agent role, goal, and backstory

This doesn't mean agent design isn't important - it absolutely is. But task design is where most execution failures occur, so prioritize accordingly.
