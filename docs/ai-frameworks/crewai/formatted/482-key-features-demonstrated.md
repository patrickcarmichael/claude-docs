## Key Features Demonstrated


This guide creator flow demonstrates several powerful features of CrewAI:

1. **User interaction**: The flow collects input directly from the user
2. **Direct LLM calls**: Uses the LLM class for efficient, single-purpose AI interactions
3. **Structured data with Pydantic**: Uses Pydantic models to ensure type safety
4. **Sequential processing with context**: Writes sections in order, providing previous sections for context
5. **Multi-agent crews**: Leverages specialized agents (writer and reviewer) for content creation
6. **State management**: Maintains state across different steps of the process
7. **Event-driven architecture**: Uses the `@listen` decorator to respond to events
