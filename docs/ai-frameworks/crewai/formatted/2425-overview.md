## Overview


The Tool Repository is a package manager for CrewAI tools. It allows users to publish, install, and manage tools that integrate with CrewAI crews and flows.

Tools can be:

* **Private**: accessible only within your organization (default)
* **Public**: accessible to all CrewAI users if published with the `--public` flag

The repository is not a version control system. Use Git to track code changes and enable collaboration.
