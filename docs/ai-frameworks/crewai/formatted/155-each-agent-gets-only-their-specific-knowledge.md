# Each agent gets only their specific knowledge

# Each can use different embedding providers
```

<Tip>
  Unlike retrieval from a vector database using a tool, agents preloaded with knowledge will not need a retrieval persona or task.
  Simply add the relevant knowledge sources your agent or crew needs to function.

  Knowledge sources can be added at the agent or crew level.
  Crew level knowledge sources will be used by **all agents** in the crew.
  Agent level knowledge sources will be used by the **specific agent** that is preloaded with the knowledge.
