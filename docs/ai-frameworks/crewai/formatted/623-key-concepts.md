## Key Concepts


* **Remote Servers**: Designed for MCP servers hosted remotely.
* **Flexibility**: Can support more complex interaction patterns than plain SSE, potentially including bi-directional communication if the server implements it.
* **`MCPServerAdapter` Configuration**: You'll need to provide the server's base URL for MCP communication and specify `"streamable-http"` as the transport type.
