## Step 10: Review the Output


Once the crew completes its work, you'll find the final report in the `output/report.md` file. The report will include:

1. An executive summary
2. Detailed information about the topic
3. Analysis and insights
4. Recommendations or future considerations

Take a moment to appreciate what you've accomplished - you've created a system where multiple AI agents collaborated on a complex task, each contributing their specialized skills to produce a result that's greater than what any single agent could achieve alone.
