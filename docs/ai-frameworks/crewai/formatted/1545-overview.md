## Overview


Trigger your automations when files are created, updated, or removed in Google Drive. Typical workflows include summarizing newly uploaded content, enforcing sharing policies, or notifying owners when critical files change.

<Tip>
  Connect Google Drive in **Tools & Integrations** and confirm the trigger is enabled for the automation you want to monitor.
