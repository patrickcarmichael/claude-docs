### Step 5: View Traces in Phoenix

After running the agent, you can view the traces generated by your CrewAI application in Phoenix. You should see detailed steps of the agent interactions and LLM calls, which can help you debug and optimize your AI agents.

Log into your Phoenix Cloud account and navigate to the project you specified in the `project_name` parameter. You'll see a timeline view of your trace with all the agent interactions, tool usages, and LLM calls.
