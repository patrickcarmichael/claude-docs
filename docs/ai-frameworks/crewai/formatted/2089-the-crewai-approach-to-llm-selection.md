## The CrewAI Approach to LLM Selection


Rather than prescriptive model recommendations, we advocate for a **thinking framework** that helps you make informed decisions based on your specific use case, constraints, and requirements. The LLM landscape evolves rapidly, with new models emerging regularly and existing ones being updated frequently. What matters most is developing a systematic approach to evaluation that remains relevant regardless of which specific models are available.

<Note>
  This guide focuses on strategic thinking rather than specific model recommendations, as the LLM landscape evolves rapidly.
