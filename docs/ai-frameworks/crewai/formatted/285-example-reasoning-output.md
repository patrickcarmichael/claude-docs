## Example Reasoning Output


Here's an example of what a reasoning plan might look like for a data analysis task:

```
Task: Analyze the provided sales data and identify key trends.

Reasoning Plan:
I'll analyze the sales data to identify the top 3 trends.

1. Understanding of the task:
   I need to analyze sales data to identify key trends that would be valuable for business decision-making.

2. Key steps I'll take:
   - First, I'll examine the data structure to understand what fields are available
   - Then I'll perform exploratory data analysis to identify patterns
   - Next, I'll analyze sales by time periods to identify temporal trends
   - I'll also analyze sales by product categories and customer segments
   - Finally, I'll identify the top 3 most significant trends

3. Approach to challenges:
   - If the data has missing values, I'll decide whether to fill or filter them
   - If the data has outliers, I'll investigate whether they're valid data points or errors
   - If trends aren't immediately obvious, I'll apply statistical methods to uncover patterns

4. Use of available tools:
   - I'll use data analysis tools to explore and visualize the data
   - I'll use statistical tools to identify significant patterns
   - I'll use knowledge retrieval to access relevant information about sales analysis

5. Expected outcome:
   A concise report highlighting the top 3 sales trends with supporting evidence from the data.

READY: I am ready to execute the task.
```

This reasoning plan helps the agent organize its approach to the task, consider potential challenges, and ensure it delivers the expected output.
