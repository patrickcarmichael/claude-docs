## Description


This tool is part of the `crewai_tools` package and is designed to perform semantic searches within Youtube video content, utilizing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques.
It is one of several "Search" tools in the package that leverage RAG for different sources.
The YoutubeVideoSearchTool allows for flexibility in searches; users can search across any Youtube video content without specifying a video URL,
or they can target their search to a specific Youtube video by providing its URL.
