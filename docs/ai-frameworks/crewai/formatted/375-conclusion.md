Low-level prompt customization in CrewAI opens the door to super custom, complex use cases. By establishing well-organized prompt files (or direct inline templates), you can accommodate various models, languages, and specialized domains. This level of flexibility ensures you can craft precisely the AI behavior you need, all while knowing CrewAI still provides reliable defaults when you don't override them.
