## Initialization and Usage


Import the DirectorySearchTool from the `crewai_tools` package to start. You can initialize the tool without specifying a directory, enabling the setting of the search directory at runtime. Alternatively, the tool can be initialized with a predefined directory.

```python Code theme={null}
from crewai_tools import DirectorySearchTool
