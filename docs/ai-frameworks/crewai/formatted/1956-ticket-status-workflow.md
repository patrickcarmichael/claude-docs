## Ticket Status Workflow


Standard ticket status progression:

* **new** - Recently created, not yet assigned
* **open** - Actively being worked on
* **pending** - Waiting for customer response or external action
* **hold** - Temporarily paused
* **solved** - Issue resolved, awaiting customer confirmation
* **closed** - Ticket completed and closed
