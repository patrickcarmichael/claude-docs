## Troubleshooting


* Verify the Outlook connector is still authorized; the subscription must be renewed periodically
* Test locally with `crewai triggers run microsoft_outlook/email_received` to see the exact payload structure
* If attachments are missing, confirm the webhook subscription includes the `includeResourceData` flag
* Review execution logs when events fail to match—cancellation payloads lack attendee lists by design and the crew should account for that
* Remember: use `crewai triggers run` (not `crewai run`) to simulate trigger execution
