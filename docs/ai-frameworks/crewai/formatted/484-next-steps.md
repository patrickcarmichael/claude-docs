## Next Steps


Now that you've built your first flow, you can:

1. Experiment with more complex flow structures and patterns
2. Try using `@router()` to create conditional branches in your flows
3. Explore the `and_` and `or_` functions for more complex parallel execution
4. Connect your flow to external APIs, databases, or user interfaces
5. Combine multiple specialized crews in a single flow

  Congratulations! You've successfully built your first CrewAI Flow that combines regular code, direct LLM calls, and crew-based processing to create a comprehensive guide. These foundational skills enable you to create increasingly sophisticated AI applications that can tackle complex, multi-stage problems through a combination of procedural control and collaborative intelligence.
