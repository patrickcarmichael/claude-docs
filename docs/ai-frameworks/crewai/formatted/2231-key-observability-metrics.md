## Key Observability Metrics


### Performance Metrics

* **Execution Time**: How long agents take to complete tasks
* **Token Usage**: Input/output tokens consumed by LLM calls
* **API Latency**: Response times from external services
* **Success Rate**: Percentage of successfully completed tasks

### Quality Metrics

* **Output Accuracy**: Correctness of agent responses
* **Consistency**: Reliability across similar inputs
* **Relevance**: How well outputs match expected results
* **Safety**: Compliance with content policies and guidelines

### Cost Metrics

* **API Costs**: Expenses from LLM provider usage
* **Resource Utilization**: Compute and memory consumption
* **Cost per Task**: Economic efficiency of agent operations
* **Budget Tracking**: Monitoring against spending limits
