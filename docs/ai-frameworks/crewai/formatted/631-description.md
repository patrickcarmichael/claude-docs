## Description


The `AIMindTool` is a wrapper around [AI-Minds](https://mindsdb.com/minds) provided by [MindsDB](https://mindsdb.com/). It allows you to query data sources in natural language by simply configuring their connection parameters. This tool is useful when you need answers to questions from your data stored in various data sources including PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, ClickHouse, Snowflake, and Google BigQuery.

Minds are AI systems that work similarly to large language models (LLMs) but go beyond by answering any question from any data. This is accomplished by:

* Selecting the most relevant data for an answer using parametric search
* Understanding the meaning and providing responses within the correct context through semantic search
* Delivering precise answers by analyzing data and using machine learning (ML) models
