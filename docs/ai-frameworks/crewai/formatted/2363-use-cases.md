## Use Cases


### Hybrid Multi-Agent Collaborations

* Create workflows where CrewAI agents collaborate with managed Bedrock agents running as services in AWS
* Enable scenarios where sensitive data processing happens within your AWS environment while other agents operate externally
* Bridge on-premises CrewAI agents with cloud-based Bedrock agents for distributed intelligence workflows

### Data Sovereignty and Compliance

* Keep data-sensitive agentic workflows within your AWS environment while allowing external CrewAI agents to orchestrate tasks
* Maintain compliance with data residency requirements by processing sensitive information only within your AWS account
* Enable secure multi-agent collaborations where some agents cannot access your organization's private data

### Seamless AWS Service Integration

* Access any AWS service through Amazon Bedrock Actions without writing complex integration code
* Enable CrewAI agents to interact with AWS services through natural language requests
* Leverage pre-built Bedrock agent capabilities to interact with AWS services like Bedrock Knowledge Bases, Lambda, and more

### Scalable Hybrid Agent Architectures

* Offload computationally intensive tasks to managed Bedrock agents while lightweight tasks run in CrewAI
* Scale agent processing by distributing workloads between local CrewAI agents and cloud-based Bedrock agents

### Cross-Organizational Agent Collaboration

* Enable secure collaboration between your organization's CrewAI agents and partner organizations' Bedrock agents
* Create workflows where external expertise from Bedrock agents can be incorporated without exposing sensitive data
* Build agent ecosystems that span organizational boundaries while maintaining security and data control
