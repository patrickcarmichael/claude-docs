## Why Update Your Crew?


CrewAI won't automatically pick up GitHub updates by default, so you'll need to manually trigger updates, unless you checked the `Auto-update` option when deploying your crew.

There are several reasons you might want to update your crew deployment:

* You want to update the code with a latest commit you pushed to GitHub
* You want to reset the bearer token for security reasons
* You want to update environment variables
