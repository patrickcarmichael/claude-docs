## Best Practices


* **Consistent Naming**: Use clear and consistent naming conventions for your methods. For example, agent methods could be named after their roles (e.g., researcher, reporting\_analyst).
* **Environment Variables**: Use environment variables for sensitive information like API keys.
* **Flexibility**: Design your crew to be flexible by allowing easy addition or removal of agents and tasks.
* **YAML-Code Correspondence**: Ensure that the names and structures in your YAML files correspond correctly to the decorated methods in your Python code.

By following these guidelines and properly using annotations, you can create well-structured and maintainable crews using the CrewAI framework.
