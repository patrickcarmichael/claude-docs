   - Create an LLM with a temperature of 0 to ensure deterministic outputs
   - Create an agent with the knowledge store
   - Supported Knowledge Sources
   - Agent vs Crew Knowledge: Complete Guide
   - Agent with its own knowledge - NO crew knowledge needed
   - No crew-level knowledge required
   - During kickoff
   - Agent knowledge storage
   - Crew knowledge storage
   - Both stored in same ChromaDB instance but different collections
   - Path: ~/.local/share/CrewAI/{project}/knowledge/
   - ├── crew/                    # Crew knowledge collection
   - ├── Technical Specialist/    # Agent knowledge collection
   - └── Another Agent Role/      # Another agent's collection
   - Agent-specific knowledge
   - No crew knowledge needed
   - Crew-wide knowledge (shared by all agents)
   - Agent-specific knowledge
   - Result:
   - - specialist gets: crew_knowledge + specialist_knowledge
2. [- generalist gets: crew_knowledge only](./02-generalist-gets-crewknowledge-only.md)
   - Different knowledge for different agents
   - Each agent gets only their specific knowledge

   - Store knowledge in project directory
   - Now all knowledge will be stored in your project directory
   - When using Claude as your LLM...
   - CrewAI will still use OpenAI embeddings by default for knowledge
   - This ensures consistency but may not match your LLM provider preference
   - Option 1: Use Voyage AI (recommended by Anthropic for Claude users)
   - Option 2: Use local embeddings (no external API calls)
   - Option 3: Agent-level embedding customization

   - MCP DSL Integration
   - Overview
   - Basic Usage
   - MCP tools are now automatically available!
   - No need for manual connection management or tool configuration
   - Supported Reference Formats
   - Basic HTTPS server
   - Server with authentication
   - Server with custom path
   - Get only the forecast tool from weather server
   - Get only the search tool from Exa
   - Full service with all tools
   - Specific tool from AMP service
   - Multiple AMP services
   - Complete Example
   - Create agent with multiple MCP sources
   - Create comprehensive research task
   - Create and execute crew
   - Tool Naming and Organization
   - Original MCP server has tools: "search", "analyze"
   - CrewAI creates tools: "mcp_exa_ai_search", "mcp_exa_ai_analyze"
   - Each server's tools get unique prefixes based on the server name
   - This prevents naming conflicts between different MCP servers
   - Error Handling and Resilience
   - Agent will:
   - 1. Successfully connect to working servers
   - 2. Log warnings for failing servers
   - 3. Continue with available tools
   - 4. Not crash or hang on server failures
   - These servers will timeout gracefully if unresponsive
   - Performance Features
   - First agent creation - discovers tools from server
   - Second agent creation (within 5 minutes) - uses cached tool schemas
   - Agent creation is fast - no MCP connections made yet
   - MCP connection is made only when a tool is actually executed
   - This minimizes connection overhead and improves startup performance
   - Integration with Existing Features
   - Best Practices
   - Good - only get the tools you need
   - Less efficient - gets all tools from server
   - Store API keys in environment variables
   - Always include backup options
   - Troubleshooting
   - Check your MCP server URL and authentication
   - Verify the server is running and accessible
   - Server may be slow or overloaded
   - CrewAI will log warnings and continue with other servers
   - Check server status or try backup servers
   - Verify API keys and credentials
   - Check server documentation for required parameters
   - Ensure query parameters are properly URL encoded
