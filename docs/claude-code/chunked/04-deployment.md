# Claude Code on Amazon Bedrock
Source: https://code.claude.com/docs/en/amazon-bedrock

Learn about configuring Claude Code through Amazon Bedrock, including setup, IAM configuration, and troubleshooting.

## Prerequisites

Before configuring Claude Code with Bedrock, ensure you have:

* An AWS account with Bedrock access enabled
* Access to desired Claude models (e.g., Claude Sonnet 4.5) in Bedrock
* AWS CLI installed and configured (optional - only needed if you don't have another mechanism for getting credentials)
* Appropriate IAM permissions

## Setup

### 1. Submit use case details

First-time users of Anthropic models are required to submit use case details before invoking a model. This is done once per account.

1. Ensure you have the right IAM permissions (see more on that below)
2. Navigate to the [Amazon Bedrock console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/)
3. Select **Chat/Text playground**
4. Choose any Anthropic model and you will be prompted to fill out the use case form

### 2. Configure AWS credentials

Claude Code uses the default AWS SDK credential chain. Set up your credentials using one of these methods:

**Option A: AWS CLI configuration**

```bash  theme={null}
aws configure
```

**Option B: Environment variables (access key)**

```bash  theme={null}
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key-id
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-access-key
export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=your-session-token
```

**Option C: Environment variables (SSO profile)**

```bash  theme={null}
aws sso login --profile=<your-profile-name>

export AWS_PROFILE=your-profile-name
```

**Option D: Bedrock API keys**

```bash  theme={null}
export AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK=your-bedrock-api-key
```

Bedrock API keys provide a simpler authentication method without needing full AWS credentials. [Learn more about Bedrock API keys](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/accelerate-ai-development-with-amazon-bedrock-api-keys/).

#### Advanced credential configuration

Claude Code supports automatic credential refresh for AWS SSO and corporate identity providers. Add these settings to your Claude Code settings file (see [Settings](/en/settings) for file locations).

When Claude Code detects that your AWS credentials are expired (either locally based on their timestamp or when Bedrock returns a credential error), it will automatically run your configured `awsAuthRefresh` and/or `awsCredentialExport` commands to obtain new credentials before retrying the request.

##### Example configuration

```json  theme={null}
{
  "awsAuthRefresh": "aws sso login --profile myprofile",
  "env": {
    "AWS_PROFILE": "myprofile"
  }
}
```

##### Configuration settings explained

**`awsAuthRefresh`**: Use this for commands that modify the `.aws` directory (e.g., updating credentials, SSO cache, or config files). Output is shown to the user (but user input is not supported), making it suitable for browser-based authentication flows where the CLI displays a code to enter in the browser.

**`awsCredentialExport`**: Only use this if you cannot modify `.aws` and must directly return credentials. Output is captured silently (not shown to the user). The command must output JSON in this format:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "Credentials": {
    "AccessKeyId": "value",
    "SecretAccessKey": "value",
    "SessionToken": "value"
  }
}
```

### 3. Configure Claude Code

Set the following environment variables to enable Bedrock:

```bash  theme={null}
# Enable Bedrock integration
export CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK=1
export AWS_REGION=us-east-1  # or your preferred region

# Optional: Override the region for the small/fast model (Haiku)
export ANTHROPIC_SMALL_FAST_MODEL_AWS_REGION=us-west-2
```

**For VS Code Extension users**: Configure environment variables in the VS Code extension settings instead of exporting them in your shell. See [Using Third-Party Providers in VS Code](/en/vs-code#using-third-party-providers-vertex-and-bedrock) for detailed instructions. All environment variables shown in this guide should work when configured through the VS Code extension settings.

When enabling Bedrock for Claude Code, keep the following in mind:

* `AWS_REGION` is a required environment variable. Claude Code does not read from the `.aws` config file for this setting.
* When using Bedrock, the `/login` and `/logout` commands are disabled since authentication is handled through AWS credentials.
* You can use settings files for environment variables like `AWS_PROFILE` that you don't want to leak to other processes. See [Settings](/en/settings) for more information.

### 4. Model configuration

Claude Code uses these default models for Bedrock:

| Model type       | Default value                                      |
| :--------------- | :------------------------------------------------- |
| Primary model    | `global.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929-v1:0` |
| Small/fast model | `us.anthropic.claude-haiku-4-5-20251001-v1:0`      |

<Note>
  For Bedrock users, Claude Code will not automatically upgrade from Haiku 3.5 to Haiku 4.5. To manually switch to a newer Haiku model, set the `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_HAIKU_MODEL` environment variable to the full model name (e.g., `us.anthropic.claude-haiku-4-5-20251001-v1:0`).
</Note>

To customize models, use one of these methods:

```bash  theme={null}
# Using inference profile ID
export ANTHROPIC_MODEL='global.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929-v1:0'
export ANTHROPIC_SMALL_FAST_MODEL='us.anthropic.claude-haiku-4-5-20251001-v1:0'

# Using application inference profile ARN
export ANTHROPIC_MODEL='arn:aws:bedrock:us-east-2:your-account-id:application-inference-profile/your-model-id'

# Optional: Disable prompt caching if needed
export DISABLE_PROMPT_CACHING=1
```

<Note>
  [Prompt caching](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-caching) may not be available in all regions
</Note>

### 5. Output token configuration

When using Claude Code with Amazon Bedrock, we recommend the following token settings:

```bash  theme={null}
# Recommended output token settings for Bedrock
export CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS=4096
export MAX_THINKING_TOKENS=1024
```

**Why these values:**

* **`CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS=4096`**: Bedrock's burndown throttling logic sets a minimum of 4096 tokens as the max\_token penalty. Setting this lower won't reduce costs but may cut off long tool uses, causing the Claude Code agent loop to fail persistently. Claude Code typically uses less than 4096 output tokens without extended thinking, but may need this headroom for tasks involving significant file creation or Write tool usage.

* **`MAX_THINKING_TOKENS=1024`**: This provides space for extended thinking without cutting off tool use responses, while still maintaining focused reasoning chains. This balance helps prevent trajectory changes that aren't always helpful for coding tasks specifically.

## IAM configuration

Create an IAM policy with the required permissions for Claude Code:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "AllowModelAndInferenceProfileAccess",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "bedrock:InvokeModel",
        "bedrock:InvokeModelWithResponseStream",
        "bedrock:ListInferenceProfiles"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:bedrock:*:*:inference-profile/*",
        "arn:aws:bedrock:*:*:application-inference-profile/*",
        "arn:aws:bedrock:*:*:foundation-model/*"
      ]
    },
    {
      "Sid": "AllowMarketplaceSubscription",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "aws-marketplace:ViewSubscriptions",
        "aws-marketplace:Subscribe"
      ],
      "Resource": "*",
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "aws:CalledViaLast": "bedrock.amazonaws.com"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

For more restrictive permissions, you can limit the Resource to specific inference profile ARNs.

For details, see [Bedrock IAM documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/security-iam.html).

<Note>
  We recommend creating a dedicated AWS account for Claude Code to simplify cost tracking and access control.
</Note>

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter region issues:

* Check model availability: `aws bedrock list-inference-profiles --region your-region`
* Switch to a supported region: `export AWS_REGION=us-east-1`
* Consider using inference profiles for cross-region access

If you receive an error "on-demand throughput isn’t supported":

* Specify the model as an [inference profile](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/inference-profiles-support.html) ID

Claude Code uses the Bedrock [Invoke API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/APIReference/API_runtime_InvokeModelWithResponseStream.html) and does not support the Converse API.

# Claude Code on the web
Source: https://code.claude.com/docs/en/claude-code-on-the-web

Run Claude Code tasks asynchronously on secure cloud infrastructure

<Note>
  Claude Code on the web is currently in research preview.
</Note>

## What is Claude Code on the web?

Claude Code on the web lets developers kick off Claude Code from the Claude app. This is perfect for:

* **Answering questions**: Ask about code architecture and how features are implemented
* **Bugfixes and routine tasks**: Well-defined tasks that don't require frequent steering
* **Parallel work**: Tackle multiple bug fixes in parallel
* **Repositories not on your local machine**: Work on code you don't have checked out locally
* **Backend changes**: Where Claude Code can write tests and then write code to pass those tests

Claude Code is also available on the Claude iOS app. This is perfect for:

* **On the go**: Kick off tasks while commuting or away from laptop
* **Monitoring**: Watch the trajectory and steer the agent's work

Developers can also move Claude Code sessions from the Claude app to their terminal to continue tasks locally.

## Who can use Claude Code on the web?

Claude Code on the web is available in research preview to:

* **Pro users**
* **Max users**

Coming soon to Team and Enterprise premium seat users.

## Getting started

1. Visit [claude.ai/code](https://claude.ai/code)
2. Connect your GitHub account
3. Install the Claude GitHub app in your repositories
4. Select your default environment
5. Submit your coding task
6. Review changes and create a pull request in GitHub

## How it works

When you start a task on Claude Code on the web:

1. **Repository cloning**: Your repository is cloned to an Anthropic-managed virtual machine
2. **Environment setup**: Claude prepares a secure cloud environment with your code
3. **Network configuration**: Internet access is configured based on your settings
4. **Task execution**: Claude analyzes code, makes changes, runs tests, and checks its work
5. **Completion**: You're notified when finished and can create a PR with the changes
6. **Results**: Changes are pushed to a branch, ready for pull request creation

## Moving tasks between web and terminal

### From web to terminal

After starting a task on the web:

1. Click the "Open in CLI" button
2. Paste and run the command in your terminal in a checkout of the repo
3. Any existing local changes will be stashed, and the remote session will be loaded
4. Continue working locally

## Cloud environment

### Default image

We build and maintain a universal image with common toolchains and language ecosystems pre-installed. This image includes:

* Popular programming languages and runtimes
* Common build tools and package managers
* Testing frameworks and linters

#### Checking available tools

To see what's pre-installed in your environment, ask Claude Code to run:

```bash  theme={null}
check-tools
```

This command displays:

* Programming languages and their versions
* Available package managers
* Installed development tools

#### Language-specific setups

The universal image includes pre-configured environments for:

* **Python**: Python 3.x with pip, poetry, and common scientific libraries
* **Node.js**: Latest LTS versions with npm, yarn, and pnpm
* **Java**: OpenJDK with Maven and Gradle
* **Go**: Latest stable version with module support
* **Rust**: Rust toolchain with cargo
* **C++**: GCC and Clang compilers

### Environment configuration

When you start a session in Claude Code on the web, here's what happens under the hood:

1. **Environment preparation**: We clone your repository and run any configured Claude hooks for initialization. The repo will be cloned with the default branch on your GitHub repo. If you would like to check out a specific branch, you can specify that in the prompt.

2. **Network configuration**: We configure internet access for the agent. Internet access is limited by default, but you can configure the environment to have no internet or full internet access based on your needs.

3. **Claude Code execution**: Claude Code runs to complete your task, writing code, running tests, and checking its work. You can guide and steer Claude throughout the session via the web interface. Claude respects context you've defined in your `CLAUDE.md`.

4. **Outcome**: When Claude completes its work, it will push the branch to remote. You will be able to create a PR for the branch.

<Note>
  Claude operates entirely through the terminal and CLI tools available in the environment. It uses the pre-installed tools in the universal image and any additional tools you install through hooks or dependency management.
</Note>

**To add a new environment:** Select the current environment to open the environment selector, and then select "Add environment". This will open a dialog where you can specify the environment name, network access level, and any environment variables you want to set.

**To update an existing environment:** Select the current environment, to the right of the environment name, and select the settings button. This will open a dialog where you can update the environment name, network access, and environment variables.

<Note>
  Environment variables must be specified as key-value pairs, in [`.env` format](https://www.dotenv.org/). For example:

  ```
  API_KEY=your_api_key
  DEBUG=true
  ```
</Note>

### Dependency management

Configure automatic dependency installation using [SessionStart hooks](/en/hooks#sessionstart). This can be configured in your repository's `.claude/settings.json` file:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "hooks": {
    "SessionStart": [
      {
        "matcher": "startup",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "\"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR\"/scripts/install_pkgs.sh"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Create the corresponding script at `scripts/install_pkgs.sh`:

```bash  theme={null}
#!/bin/bash
npm install
pip install -r requirements.txt
exit 0
```

Make it executable: `chmod +x scripts/install_pkgs.sh`

#### Local vs remote execution

By default, all hooks execute both locally and in remote (web) environments. To run a hook only in one environment, check the `CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE` environment variable in your hook script.

```bash  theme={null}
#!/bin/bash

# Example: Only run in remote environments
if [ "$CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE" != "true" ]; then
  exit 0
fi

npm install
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Persisting environment variables

SessionStart hooks can persist environment variables for subsequent bash commands by writing to the file specified in the `CLAUDE_ENV_FILE` environment variable. For details, see [SessionStart hooks](/en/hooks#sessionstart) in the hooks reference.

## Network access and security

### Network policy

#### GitHub proxy

For security, all GitHub operations go through a dedicated proxy service that transparently handles all git interactions. Inside the sandbox, the git client authenticates using a custom-built scoped credential. This proxy:

* Manages GitHub authentication securely - the git client uses a scoped credential inside the sandbox, which the proxy verifies and translates to your actual GitHub authentication token
* Restricts git push operations to the current working branch for safety
* Enables seamless cloning, fetching, and PR operations while maintaining security boundaries

#### Security proxy

Environments run behind an HTTP/HTTPS network proxy for security and abuse prevention purposes. All outbound internet traffic passes through this proxy, which provides:

* Protection against malicious requests
* Rate limiting and abuse prevention
* Content filtering for enhanced security

### Access levels

By default, network access is limited to [allowlisted domains](#default-allowed-domains).

You can configure custom network access, including disabling network access.

### Default allowed domains

When using "Limited" network access, the following domains are allowed by default:

#### Anthropic Services

</Note>

### Security best practices for customized network access

1. **Principle of least privilege**: Only enable the minimum network access required
2. **Audit regularly**: Review allowed domains periodically
3. **Use HTTPS**: Always prefer HTTPS endpoints over HTTP

## Security and isolation

Claude Code on the web provides strong security guarantees:

* **Isolated virtual machines**: Each session runs in an isolated, Anthropic-managed VM
* **Network access controls**: Network access is limited by default, and can be disabled

<Note>
  When running with network access disabled, Claude Code is allowed to communicate with the Anthropic API which may still allow data to exit the isolated Claude Code VM.
</Note>

* **Credential protection**: Sensitive credentials (such as git credentials or signing keys) are never inside the sandbox with Claude Code. Authentication is handled through a secure proxy using scoped credentials
* **Secure analysis**: Code is analyzed and modified within isolated VMs before creating PRs

## Pricing and rate limits

Claude Code on the web shares rate limits with all other Claude and Claude Code usage within your account. Running multiple tasks in parallel will consume more rate limits proportionately.

## Limitations

* **Repository authentication**: You can only move sessions from web to local when you are authenticated to the same account
* **Platform restrictions**: Claude Code on the web only works with code hosted in GitHub. GitLab and other non-GitHub repositories cannot be used with cloud sessions

## Best practices

1. **Use Claude Code hooks**: Configure [sessionStart hooks](/en/hooks#sessionstart) to automate environment setup and dependency installation.
2. **Document requirements**: Clearly specify dependencies and commands in your `CLAUDE.md` file. If you have an `AGENTS.md` file, you can source it in your `CLAUDE.md` using `@AGENTS.md` to maintain a single source of truth.

# Development containers
Source: https://code.claude.com/docs/en/devcontainer

Learn about the Claude Code development container for teams that need consistent, secure environments.

The reference [devcontainer setup](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/tree/main/.devcontainer) and associated [Dockerfile](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/blob/main/.devcontainer/Dockerfile) offer a preconfigured development container that you can use as is, or customize for your needs. This devcontainer works with the Visual Studio Code [Dev Containers extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) and similar tools.

The container's enhanced security measures (isolation and firewall rules) allow you to run `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions` to bypass permission prompts for unattended operation.

<Warning>
  While the devcontainer provides substantial protections, no system is completely immune to all attacks.
  When executed with `--dangerously-skip-permissions`, devcontainers do not prevent a malicious project from exfiltrating anything accessible in the devcontainer including Claude Code credentials.
  We recommend only using devcontainers when developing with trusted repositories.
  Always maintain good security practices and monitor Claude's activities.
</Warning>

## Key features

* **Production-ready Node.js**: Built on Node.js 20 with essential development dependencies
* **Security by design**: Custom firewall restricting network access to only necessary services
* **Developer-friendly tools**: Includes git, ZSH with productivity enhancements, fzf, and more
* **Seamless VS Code integration**: Pre-configured extensions and optimized settings
* **Session persistence**: Preserves command history and configurations between container restarts
* **Works everywhere**: Compatible with macOS, Windows, and Linux development environments

## Getting started in 4 steps

1. Install VS Code and the Remote - Containers extension
2. Clone the [Claude Code reference implementation](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/tree/main/.devcontainer) repository
3. Open the repository in VS Code
4. When prompted, click "Reopen in Container" (or use Command Palette: Cmd+Shift+P → "Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container")

## Configuration breakdown

The devcontainer setup consists of three primary components:

* [**devcontainer.json**](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/blob/main/.devcontainer/devcontainer.json): Controls container settings, extensions, and volume mounts
* [**Dockerfile**](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/blob/main/.devcontainer/Dockerfile): Defines the container image and installed tools
* [**init-firewall.sh**](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/blob/main/.devcontainer/init-firewall.sh): Establishes network security rules

## Security features

The container implements a multi-layered security approach with its firewall configuration:

* **Precise access control**: Restricts outbound connections to whitelisted domains only (npm registry, GitHub, Claude API, etc.)
* **Allowed outbound connections**: The firewall permits outbound DNS and SSH connections
* **Default-deny policy**: Blocks all other external network access
* **Startup verification**: Validates firewall rules when the container initializes
* **Isolation**: Creates a secure development environment separated from your main system

## Customization options

The devcontainer configuration is designed to be adaptable to your needs:

* Add or remove VS Code extensions based on your workflow
* Modify resource allocations for different hardware environments
* Adjust network access permissions
* Customize shell configurations and developer tooling

## Example use cases

### Secure client work

Use devcontainers to isolate different client projects, ensuring code and credentials never mix between environments.

### Team onboarding

New team members can get a fully configured development environment in minutes, with all necessary tools and settings pre-installed.

### Consistent CI/CD environments

Mirror your devcontainer configuration in CI/CD pipelines to ensure development and production environments match.

# Claude Code on Google Vertex AI
Source: https://code.claude.com/docs/en/google-vertex-ai

Learn about configuring Claude Code through Google Vertex AI, including setup, IAM configuration, and troubleshooting.

## Prerequisites

Before configuring Claude Code with Vertex AI, ensure you have:

* A Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account with billing enabled
* A GCP project with Vertex AI API enabled
* Access to desired Claude models (e.g., Claude Sonnet 4.5)
* Google Cloud SDK (`gcloud`) installed and configured
* Quota allocated in desired GCP region

## Region Configuration

Claude Code can be used with both Vertex AI [global](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/global-endpoint-for-claude-models-generally-available-on-vertex-ai) and regional endpoints.

<Note>
  Vertex AI may not support the Claude Code default models on all regions. You may need to switch to a [supported region or model](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/locations#genai-partner-models).
</Note>

<Note>
  Vertex AI may not support the Claude Code default models on global endpoints. You may need to switch to a regional endpoint or [supported model](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/partner-models/use-partner-models#supported_models).
</Note>

## Setup

### 1. Enable Vertex AI API

Enable the Vertex AI API in your GCP project:

```bash  theme={null}
# Set your project ID
gcloud config set project YOUR-PROJECT-ID

# Enable Vertex AI API
gcloud services enable aiplatform.googleapis.com
```

### 2. Request model access

Request access to Claude models in Vertex AI:

1. Navigate to the [Vertex AI Model Garden](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/model-garden)
2. Search for "Claude" models
3. Request access to desired Claude models (e.g., Claude Sonnet 4.5)
4. Wait for approval (may take 24-48 hours)

### 3. Configure GCP credentials

Claude Code uses standard Google Cloud authentication.

For more information, see [Google Cloud authentication documentation](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication).

<Note>
  When authenticating, Claude Code will automatically use the project ID from the `ANTHROPIC_VERTEX_PROJECT_ID` environment variable. To override this, set one of these environment variables: `GCLOUD_PROJECT`, `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT`, or `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`.
</Note>

### 4. Configure Claude Code

Set the following environment variables:

```bash  theme={null}
# Enable Vertex AI integration
export CLAUDE_CODE_USE_VERTEX=1
export CLOUD_ML_REGION=global
export ANTHROPIC_VERTEX_PROJECT_ID=YOUR-PROJECT-ID

# Optional: Disable prompt caching if needed
export DISABLE_PROMPT_CACHING=1

# When CLOUD_ML_REGION=global, override region for unsupported models
export VERTEX_REGION_CLAUDE_3_5_HAIKU=us-east5

# Optional: Override regions for other specific models
export VERTEX_REGION_CLAUDE_3_5_SONNET=us-east5
export VERTEX_REGION_CLAUDE_3_7_SONNET=us-east5
export VERTEX_REGION_CLAUDE_4_0_OPUS=europe-west1
export VERTEX_REGION_CLAUDE_4_0_SONNET=us-east5
export VERTEX_REGION_CLAUDE_4_1_OPUS=europe-west1
```

<Note>
  [Prompt caching](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-caching) is automatically supported when you specify the `cache_control` ephemeral flag. To disable it, set `DISABLE_PROMPT_CACHING=1`. For heightened rate limits, contact Google Cloud support.
</Note>

<Note>
  When using Vertex AI, the `/login` and `/logout` commands are disabled since authentication is handled through Google Cloud credentials.
</Note>

### 5. Model configuration

Claude Code uses these default models for Vertex AI:

| Model type       | Default value                |
| :--------------- | :--------------------------- |
| Primary model    | `claude-sonnet-4-5@20250929` |
| Small/fast model | `claude-haiku-4-5@20251001`  |

<Note>
  For Vertex AI users, Claude Code will not automatically upgrade from Haiku 3.5 to Haiku 4.5. To manually switch to a newer Haiku model, set the `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_HAIKU_MODEL` environment variable to the full model name (e.g., `claude-haiku-4-5@20251001`).
</Note>

To customize models:

```bash  theme={null}
export ANTHROPIC_MODEL='claude-opus-4-1@20250805'
export ANTHROPIC_SMALL_FAST_MODEL='claude-haiku-4-5@20251001'
```

## IAM configuration

Assign the required IAM permissions:

The `roles/aiplatform.user` role includes the required permissions:

* `aiplatform.endpoints.predict` - Required for model invocation and token counting

For more restrictive permissions, create a custom role with only the permissions above.

For details, see [Vertex IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/general/access-control).

<Note>
  We recommend creating a dedicated GCP project for Claude Code to simplify cost tracking and access control.
</Note>

## 1M token context window

Claude Sonnet 4 and Sonnet 4.5 support the [1M token context window](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/context-windows#1m-token-context-window) on Vertex AI.

<Note>
  The 1M token context window is currently in beta. To use the extended context window, include the `context-1m-2025-08-07` beta header in your Vertex AI requests.
</Note>

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter quota issues:

* Check current quotas or request quota increase through [Cloud Console](https://cloud.google.com/docs/quotas/view-manage)

If you encounter "model not found" 404 errors:

* Confirm model is Enabled in [Model Garden](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/model-garden)
* Verify you have access to the specified region
* If using `CLOUD_ML_REGION=global`, check that your models support global endpoints in [Model Garden](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/model-garden) under "Supported features". For models that don't support global endpoints, either:
  * Specify a supported model via `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` or `ANTHROPIC_SMALL_FAST_MODEL`, or
  * Set a regional endpoint using `VERTEX_REGION_<MODEL_NAME>` environment variables

If you encounter 429 errors:

* For regional endpoints, ensure the primary model and small/fast model are supported in your selected region
* Consider switching to `CLOUD_ML_REGION=global` for better availability

# LLM gateway configuration
Source: https://code.claude.com/docs/en/llm-gateway

Learn how to configure Claude Code with LLM gateway solutions, including LiteLLM setup, authentication methods, and enterprise features like usage tracking and budget management.

LLM gateways provide a centralized proxy layer between Claude Code and model providers, offering:

* **Centralized authentication** - Single point for API key management
* **Usage tracking** - Monitor usage across teams and projects
* **Cost controls** - Implement budgets and rate limits
* **Audit logging** - Track all model interactions for compliance
* **Model routing** - Switch between providers without code changes

## LiteLLM configuration

<Note>
  LiteLLM is a third-party proxy service. Anthropic doesn't endorse, maintain, or audit LiteLLM's security or functionality. This guide is provided for informational purposes and may become outdated. Use at your own discretion.
</Note>

### Prerequisites

* Claude Code updated to the latest version
* LiteLLM Proxy Server deployed and accessible
* Access to Claude models through your chosen provider

### Basic LiteLLM setup

**Configure Claude Code**:

#### Authentication methods

##### Static API key

Simplest method using a fixed API key:

```bash  theme={null}
# Set in environment
export ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN=sk-litellm-static-key

# Or in Claude Code settings
{
  "env": {
    "ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN": "sk-litellm-static-key"
  }
}
```

This value will be sent as the `Authorization` header.

##### Dynamic API key with helper

For rotating keys or per-user authentication:

1. Create an API key helper script:

```bash  theme={null}
#!/bin/bash
# ~/bin/get-litellm-key.sh

# Example: Fetch key from vault
vault kv get -field=api_key secret/litellm/claude-code

# Example: Generate JWT token
jwt encode \
  --secret="${JWT_SECRET}" \
  --exp="+1h" \
  '{"user":"'${USER}'","team":"engineering"}'
```

2. Configure Claude Code settings to use the helper:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "apiKeyHelper": "~/bin/get-litellm-key.sh"
}
```

3. Set token refresh interval:

```bash  theme={null}
# Refresh every hour (3600000 ms)
export CLAUDE_CODE_API_KEY_HELPER_TTL_MS=3600000
```

This value will be sent as `Authorization` and `X-Api-Key` headers. The `apiKeyHelper` has lower precedence than `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.

#### Unified endpoint (recommended)

Using LiteLLM's [Anthropic format endpoint](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/anthropic_unified):

```bash  theme={null}
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=https://litellm-server:4000
```

**Benefits of the unified endpoint over pass-through endpoints:**

* Load balancing
* Fallbacks
* Consistent support for cost tracking and end-user tracking

#### Provider-specific pass-through endpoints (alternative)

##### Claude API through LiteLLM

Using [pass-through endpoint](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/pass_through/anthropic_completion):

```bash  theme={null}
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=https://litellm-server:4000/anthropic
```

##### Amazon Bedrock through LiteLLM

Using [pass-through endpoint](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/pass_through/bedrock):

```bash  theme={null}
export ANTHROPIC_BEDROCK_BASE_URL=https://litellm-server:4000/bedrock
export CLAUDE_CODE_SKIP_BEDROCK_AUTH=1
export CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK=1
```

##### Google Vertex AI through LiteLLM

Using [pass-through endpoint](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/pass_through/vertex_ai):

```bash  theme={null}
export ANTHROPIC_VERTEX_BASE_URL=https://litellm-server:4000/vertex_ai/v1
export ANTHROPIC_VERTEX_PROJECT_ID=your-gcp-project-id
export CLAUDE_CODE_SKIP_VERTEX_AUTH=1
export CLAUDE_CODE_USE_VERTEX=1
export CLOUD_ML_REGION=us-east5
```

### Model selection

By default, the models will use those specified in [Model configuration](/en/third-party-integrations#model-configuration).

If you have configured custom model names in LiteLLM, set the aforementioned environment variables to those custom names.

For more detailed information, refer to the [LiteLLM documentation](https://docs.litellm.ai/).

# Enterprise network configuration
Source: https://code.claude.com/docs/en/network-config

Configure Claude Code for enterprise environments with proxy servers, custom Certificate Authorities (CA), and mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS) authentication.

Claude Code supports various enterprise network and security configurations through environment variables. This includes routing traffic through corporate proxy servers, trusting custom Certificate Authorities (CA), and authenticating with mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS) certificates for enhanced security.

<Note>
  All environment variables shown on this page can also be configured in [`settings.json`](/en/settings).
</Note>

## Proxy configuration

### Environment variables

Claude Code respects standard proxy environment variables:

```bash  theme={null}
# HTTPS proxy (recommended)
export HTTPS_PROXY=https://proxy.example.com:8080

# HTTP proxy (if HTTPS not available)
export HTTP_PROXY=http://proxy.example.com:8080

# Bypass proxy for specific requests - space-separated format
export NO_PROXY="localhost 192.168.1.1 example.com .example.com"
# Bypass proxy for specific requests - comma-separated format
export NO_PROXY="localhost,192.168.1.1,example.com,.example.com"
# Bypass proxy for all requests
export NO_PROXY="*"
```

<Note>
  Claude Code does not support SOCKS proxies.
</Note>

### Basic authentication

If your proxy requires basic authentication, include credentials in the proxy URL:

```bash  theme={null}
export HTTPS_PROXY=http://username:password@proxy.example.com:8080
```

<Warning>
  Avoid hardcoding passwords in scripts. Use environment variables or secure credential storage instead.
</Warning>

<Tip>
  For proxies requiring advanced authentication (NTLM, Kerberos, etc.), consider using an LLM Gateway service that supports your authentication method.
</Tip>

## Custom CA certificates

If your enterprise environment uses custom CAs for HTTPS connections (whether through a proxy or direct API access), configure Claude Code to trust them:

```bash  theme={null}
export NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS=/path/to/ca-cert.pem
```

## mTLS authentication

For enterprise environments requiring client certificate authentication:

```bash  theme={null}
# Client certificate for authentication
export CLAUDE_CODE_CLIENT_CERT=/path/to/client-cert.pem

# Client private key
export CLAUDE_CODE_CLIENT_KEY=/path/to/client-key.pem

# Optional: Passphrase for encrypted private key
export CLAUDE_CODE_CLIENT_KEY_PASSPHRASE="your-passphrase"
```

## Network access requirements

Claude Code requires access to the following URLs:

* `api.anthropic.com` - Claude API endpoints
* `claude.ai` - WebFetch safeguards
* `statsig.anthropic.com` - Telemetry and metrics
* `sentry.io` - Error reporting

Ensure these URLs are allowlisted in your proxy configuration and firewall rules. This is especially important when using Claude Code in containerized or restricted network environments.

## Configuration overview

Claude Code supports flexible configuration options that allow you to combine different providers and infrastructure:

<Note>
  Understand the difference between:

  * **Corporate proxy**: An HTTP/HTTPS proxy for routing traffic (set via `HTTPS_PROXY` or `HTTP_PROXY`)
  * **LLM Gateway**: A service that handles authentication and provides provider-compatible endpoints (set via `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`, `ANTHROPIC_BEDROCK_BASE_URL`, or `ANTHROPIC_VERTEX_BASE_URL`)

  Both configurations can be used in tandem.
</Note>

### Using Bedrock with corporate proxy

Route Bedrock traffic through a corporate HTTP/HTTPS proxy:

```bash  theme={null}
# Enable Bedrock
export CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK=1
export AWS_REGION=us-east-1

# Configure corporate proxy
export HTTPS_PROXY='https://proxy.example.com:8080'
```

### Using Bedrock with LLM Gateway

Use a gateway service that provides Bedrock-compatible endpoints:

```bash  theme={null}
# Enable Bedrock
export CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK=1

# Configure LLM gateway
export ANTHROPIC_BEDROCK_BASE_URL='https://your-llm-gateway.com/bedrock'
export CLAUDE_CODE_SKIP_BEDROCK_AUTH=1  # If gateway handles AWS auth
```

### Using Vertex AI with corporate proxy

Route Vertex AI traffic through a corporate HTTP/HTTPS proxy:

```bash  theme={null}
# Enable Vertex
export CLAUDE_CODE_USE_VERTEX=1
export CLOUD_ML_REGION=us-east5
export ANTHROPIC_VERTEX_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id

# Configure corporate proxy
export HTTPS_PROXY='https://proxy.example.com:8080'
```

### Using Vertex AI with LLM Gateway

Combine Google Vertex AI models with an LLM gateway for centralized management:

```bash  theme={null}
# Enable Vertex
export CLAUDE_CODE_USE_VERTEX=1

# Configure LLM gateway
export ANTHROPIC_VERTEX_BASE_URL='https://your-llm-gateway.com/vertex'
export CLAUDE_CODE_SKIP_VERTEX_AUTH=1  # If gateway handles GCP auth
```

### Authentication configuration

Claude Code uses the `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` for the `Authorization` header when needed. The `SKIP_AUTH` flags (`CLAUDE_CODE_SKIP_BEDROCK_AUTH`, `CLAUDE_CODE_SKIP_VERTEX_AUTH`) are used in LLM gateway scenarios where the gateway handles provider authentication.

## Choosing the right deployment configuration

Consider these factors when selecting your deployment approach:

### Direct provider access

Best for organizations that:

* Want the simplest setup
* Have existing AWS or GCP infrastructure
* Need provider-native monitoring and compliance

### Corporate proxy

Best for organizations that:

* Have existing corporate proxy requirements
* Need traffic monitoring and compliance
* Must route all traffic through specific network paths

### LLM Gateway

Best for organizations that:

* Need usage tracking across teams
* Want to dynamically switch between models
* Require custom rate limiting or budgets
* Need centralized authentication management

## Debugging

When debugging your deployment:

* Use the `claude /status` [slash command](/en/slash-commands). This command provides observability into any applied authentication, proxy, and URL settings.
* Set environment variable `export ANTHROPIC_LOG=debug` to log requests.

## Best practices for organizations

### 1. Invest in documentation and memory

We strongly recommend investing in documentation so that Claude Code understands your codebase. Organizations can deploy CLAUDE.md files at multiple levels:

* **Organization-wide**: Deploy to system directories like `/Library/Application Support/ClaudeCode/CLAUDE.md` (macOS) for company-wide standards
* **Repository-level**: Create `CLAUDE.md` files in repository roots containing project architecture, build commands, and contribution guidelines. Check these into source control so all users benefit

  [Learn more](/en/memory).

### 2. Simplify deployment

If you have a custom development environment, we find that creating a "one click" way to install Claude Code is key to growing adoption across an organization.

### 3. Start with guided usage

Encourage new users to try Claude Code for codebase Q\&A, or on smaller bug fixes or feature requests. Ask Claude Code to make a plan. Check Claude's suggestions and give feedback if it's off-track. Over time, as users understand this new paradigm better, then they'll be more effective at letting Claude Code run more agentically.

### 4. Configure security policies

Security teams can configure managed permissions for what Claude Code is and is not allowed to do, which cannot be overwritten by local configuration. [Learn more](/en/security).

### 5. Leverage MCP for integrations

MCP is a great way to give Claude Code more information, such as connecting to ticket management systems or error logs. We recommend that one central team configures MCP servers and checks a `.mcp.json` configuration into the codebase so that all users benefit. [Learn more](/en/mcp).

At Anthropic, we trust Claude Code to power development across every Anthropic codebase. We hope you enjoy using Claude Code as much as we do!
