# Memories
Source: https://docs.cursor.com/en/context/memories



Memories are automatically generated rules based on your conversations in Chat. These memories are scoped to your project and maintain context across sessions.

## How memories are created

1. **Sidecar observation**: Cursor uses a sidecar approach where another model observes your conversations and automatically extracts relevant memories. This happens passively in the background as you work. Background-generated memories require user approval before being saved, ensuring trust and control over what gets remembered.

2. **Tool calls**: Agent can directly create memories using tool calls when you explicitly ask it to remember something or when it notices important information that should be preserved for future sessions.

## Manage memories

You can manage memories from Cursor Settings → Rules.
