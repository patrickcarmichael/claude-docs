# List Models
Source: https://docs.cursor.com/en/background-agent/api/list-models

en/background-agent/api/openapi.yaml get /v0/models
Retrieve a list of recommended models for background agents.

If you want to provide the background agent's model during creation, you can use this endpoint to see a list of recommended models.

In that case, we also recommend having an "Auto" option, in which you would not provide a model name to the creation endpoint,
and we will pick the most appropriate model.
