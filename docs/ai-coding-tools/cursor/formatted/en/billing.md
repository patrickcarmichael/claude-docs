Managing Cursor subscriptions, refunds, and invoices 

### How do I access billing settings?

Access the billing portal through the [Dashboard](https://cursor.com/dashboard) by clicking "Billing" in your Dashboard. This opens a secure portal for all billing tasks.

### What are Cursor's billing cycles?

Billing cycles run monthly or annually, starting on your subscription date. Teams accounts are charged per seat with pro-rated billing for new members.

### How do seats work for Teams accounts?

Teams accounts charge per seat (one per Team member). When adding members mid-cycle, you're only charged for their remaining time. If a member has used any credits and is removed, their seat remains occupied until the end of the billing cycle - no pro-rated refunds are given. Team admins can manage seats through the dashboard.

### Can I switch between monthly and annual billing?

Yes! Here's how:

**Pro plan**

1. Go to the Cursor [dashboard](https://cursor.com/dashboard)
2. Click "Billing and Invoices" from the left sidebar to reach the billing page
3. Click "Manage subscription"

**Teams plan**

### Where can I find my invoices?

Find all billing history in the billing portal. View and download current and past invoices.

### Can I get invoices automatically emailed to me?

Invoices must be downloaded manually from the billing portal. We're developing automatic invoice emails. You'll be able to opt-in once available.

### How do I update my billing information?

Update payment method, company name, address, and tax information through the billing portal. We use Stripe for secure transactions. Changes only affect future invoices, we cannot modify historical invoices.

### How do I cancel my subscription?

Cancel your subscription through the Billing and Invoices page by clicking "Manage Subscription" the "Cancel subscription" button. Access continues until the end of your current billing period.

### I'm having other billing issues. How can I get help?
