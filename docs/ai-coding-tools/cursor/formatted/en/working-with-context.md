How to work with context in Cursor

First, what is a context window? And how does it relate to effectively coding with Cursor?

To zoom out a bit, a large language model (LLM) is an artificial intelligence model trained to predict and generate text by learning patterns from massive datasets. It powers tools like Cursor by understanding your input and suggesting code or text based on what it’s seen before.

Tokens are the inputs and outputs of these models. They are chunks of text, often a fragment of a word, that an LLM processes one-by-one. Models don’t read entire sentences at once; they predict the next token based on the ones that came before.

To see how some text tokenizes, you can use a tokenizer like [this one](https://tiktokenizer.vercel.app/).
