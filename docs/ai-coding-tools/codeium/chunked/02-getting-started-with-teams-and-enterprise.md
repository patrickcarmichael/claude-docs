# Plans and Credit Usage
Source: https://docs.windsurf.com/plugins/accounts/usage



Prompt credits are consumed whenever a message is sent to Cascade with a premium model. Every model has it's own credit multiplier with the default message costing 1 credit. You can view all available models and their associated costs on the [models page.](/windsurf/models)

Upon using all of your credits, select premium models will no longer be accessible; however, you will still be able to use several other models that we've made available for free.

## Plans

The [Free](#using-a-free-plan) plan includes:

* 25 prompt credits
* Unlimited Windsurf Tab

The 2 week [Pro Trial](#using-a-free-pro-trial) includes:

* 100 prompt credits
* Unlimited Windsurf Tab

The [Pro](#using-pro-plan) plan includes everything in Free, but with:

* 500 prompt credits
* Add-on prompt credits at \$10/250 credits
* All premium models

The [Teams](#using-teams-plan) plan includes everything in Pro, but with:

* 500 prompt credits/user/month
* Add-on prompt credits at \$40/1000 credits
* Centralized billing
* Admin dashboard with analytics
* Priority support
* Access control features available to add

The [Enterprise](#using-enterprise-plan) plan includes everything in Teams, but with:

* 1000 prompt credits/user/month
* Add-on prompt credits at \$40/1000 credits
* Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
* SSO & SCIM
* Highest priority support
* Longer context

If you run out of credits on any paid plan, you will have the option of [purchasing additional credits](#purchasing-additional-credits) or setting up [Automatic Credit Refills](#automatic-credit-refills).

After upgrading, your paid plan will start immediately and you'll have access to premium models again. To learn more about the quotas and features per pricing plan, [click here](https://codeium.com/pricing).

## Errors

If a user message is unsuccessful, prompt credits will not be consumed. For example, if Cascade attempts to write to a file but that file has unsaved changes, the operation will fail and it will not consume a credit.

## Viewing your usage

There are a few ways to view your usage.

Go to the Cascade usage directly by clicking on the overflow menu, and then selecting "Cascade Usage".

View the settings panel by clicking on "Windsurf Settings" on the status bar, followed by selecting the "Plan Info" tab.

You can also view it on your plan page at [codeium.com/plan](https://codeium.com/plan) after you're authenticated.

## Upgrading to a paid plan

To learn more about paid features or to upgrade to a paid plan, [click here](https://codeium.com/plan). Paid plans include Pro for individuals, Teams for organizations, and Enterprise for larger companies.

We accept all major credit cards, Apple Pay, Cash App Pay, Google Pay, Link, WeChat Pay, and Alipay. If you have a payment method not listed, please reach out to us at [support](https://codeium.com/support). You may need to disable your VPN to view the relevant payment methods for your region.

## What happens when you run out of prompt credits?

If you no longer have prompt credits, you have two options:

* You can purchase additional prompt credits to continue using premium models

* You can use Write or Chat mode with the models that cost 0 credits!

## Automatic Credit Refills

We've introduced Automatic Credit Refills so that you no longer need to manually purchase additional credits. Under your plan settings page on the Windsurf website, you can specify a maximum amount of credits and other refill settings. The system will automatically "top-up" your credits as you start running low (below 15 credits).

Automatic Credit Refills are purchased in configurable increments (multiples of \$10 for Pro and \$40 for Teams) and subject to maximum monthly budget caps (\$50 by default for Pro users and \$160 for Teams users). This ensures you won't lose access to Cascade during critical work.

## Purchasing additional credits

If you run out of prompt credits, you can purchase additional credits in the [billing website](https://codeium.com/plan). Additional prompt credits can be purchased at a rate of \$10 for 250 credits for Pro users.

For Team and Enterprise plans, additional credits are purchased within and treated as a pool amongst all members of the team at a rate of \$40 for 1000 pooled credits. Please contact your Teams admin to purchase more credits if you're on a team plan.

## Usage examples

To explain how credits work, here's a simple example:

When you send a message to Cascade with a premium model, 1 prompt credit is consumed. It doesn't matter how many actions Cascade takes to fulfill your request - whether it searches your codebase, analyzes files, or makes edits - you only pay for the initial prompt.

This simplified system makes it much easier to predict and manage your usage. No more complicated calculations of flow actions or different credit types.

## Plan Usage

### Using a Free Pro Trial

The Pro Trial lasts for 2 weeks and includes unlimited Windsurf Tab, 100 prompt credits, Previews, and Deploys.

When you're on a Pro Trial, you'll have access to premium features! To get started, ask Cascade a question. In Write and Chat mode, Cascade is optimized to fully understand your codebase and leverages tool calls to assist you. By default, all of your requests will use premium models until you run out of credits.

After your trial period ends, you'll need to upgrade to a paid plan to continue using premium models.

If you don't upgrade during the Free Trial period, you'll be downgraded to our Free plan which includes 25 prompt credits per month.

### Using Pro Plan

The Pro plan costs \$15/month and includes:

* 500 prompt credits/month
* All premium models
* Previews
* App Deploys

Additional prompt credits can be purchased at a rate of \$10 for 250 credits.

While on Pro, you'll have access to a monthly quota of prompt credits. You can view how many credits you have remaining in the Windsurf Settings panel that's accessible in the status bar.

If you're running low on credits, Cascade will notify you so that you can purchase additional credits or enable Automatic Credit Refills. To purchase additional credits, visit the billing website and select "Purchase credits". The credits purchased will rollover to the following usage month if there are any remaining.

If you want to reduce your consumption of prompt credits, there are several available models that cost 0 credits!

In addition to prompt credits, Pro comes with unlimited Fast Autocomplete and unlimited premium model requests with Command.

### Using Teams Plan

The Teams plan costs \$30/user/month (up to 200 users) and includes:

* 500 prompt credits/user/month
* Everything in Pro, plus:
* Centralized billing
* Admin dashboard with analytics
* Priority support

Additional prompt credits can be purchased at a rate of \$40 for 1000 pooled credits.

The Teams plan has a seat cap of 200 users. Coming soon, there will be an option to add Access Control features for +\$10/user/month.

While on the Teams plan, each user will have access to a monthly quota of prompt credits. Unlike the previous system, base prompt credits are not pooled - each user has their own credit limit. However, purchased add-on prompt credits are pooled across the organization. You can view how many credits your team has remaining in the Windsurf Settings panel.

If your team is running low on credits, your administrator can purchase additional credits or enable Automatic Credit Refills. These add-on prompt credits purchased will rollover to the following usage month if there are any remaining.

### Using Enterprise Plan

The Enterprise plan costs \$60/user/month (up to 200 users) and includes everything in Teams plus:

* 1000 prompt credits/user/month
* Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
* SSO & SCIM (included)
* Longer model context lengths
* Highest priority support

Additional prompt credits can be purchased at a rate of \$40 for 1000 pooled credits.

Coming soon, Enterprise will be self-serviceable with month-to-month pricing. The Enterprise plan includes self-serve SSO integration and enhanced security features.

For enterprise support, account management, and more involved deployments such as Hybrid or FedRAMP under an annual commitment, contact our enterprise team at [trust.windsurf.com](https://trust.windsurf.com) for any standard security collateral.

### Using a Free plan

The Free plan comes with:

* 25 prompt credits/month
* Unlimited Windsurf Tab

Windsurf can still be used for free after your credits are exhausted! There are several models available that cost 0 credits to use.

When editing code, you'll have access to unlimited Tab completions and AI command instructions. To learn more about features in Free and in paid tiers, [click here](https://codeium.com/pricing).

## Viewing or updating your payment & billing information

You can now update your payment method, billing details, tax ID, and view past invoices directly from your Windsurf account. Follow the steps below to make changes securely via Stripe.

Visit [windsurf.com/team/manage-plan](https://windsurf.com/team/manage-plan) and log into your account if prompted.
You can view and download your previous invoices and receipts.

* On the billing page, select the Update Payment button.
* A secure Stripe pop-up will appear. This will redirect you to your customer portal on Stripe. From the Stripe portal, you can:

* Update your billing and shipping information (name or company name, tax identification, email, and address)
* Once you’ve made the updates, save your changes and close the window.

## Canceling your paid plan

As a paid individial user, you can cancel your plan at any time by browsing to the [windsurf.com/subscription/plan-management](https://windsurf.com/subscription/plan-management) page.
Upon canceling your paid plan, you'll still have access to all of your credits from your monthly quota and add-on prompt credits until the end of the usage month. After the usage month, all add-on prompt credits will expire and you'll be downgraded to the Free plan where you'll be provided a limited number of prompt credits.
If you change your mind and decide not to cancel before the end of the usage month, you can renew your plan by visiting the billing page.

For Teams or Enterprise plans, only the admin can cancel the plan, delete the team and remove users.

Write mode allows Cascade to create and make modifications to your codebase, while Chat mode is optimized for questions around your codebase or general coding principles.

<video autoPlay muted loop playsInline className="w-full aspect-video" src="https://mintcdn.com/codeium/d8O4q6w3H2CjrirL/assets/jetbrains-cascade-modes.mp4?fit=max&auto=format&n=d8O4q6w3H2CjrirL&q=85&s=dab1edae206eabdc1a675462866b1ad6" data-path="assets/jetbrains-cascade-modes.mp4" />


# Queued Messages

While you are waiting for Cascade to finish its current task, you can queue up new messages to execute in order once the task is complete.

To add a message to the queue, simply type in your message while Cascade is working and press `Enter`.

* **Send immediately**: Press Enter again on an empty text box to send it right away.
* **Delete**: Remove any message from the queue before it's sent


# Access to Tools

Cascade has a variety of tools at its disposal, such as Search, Analyze, [Web Search](/windsurf/web-search), and the [terminal](/windsurf/terminal).

It can detect which packages and tools that you're using, which ones need to be installed, and even install them for you. Just ask Cascade how to run your project and press Accept.

<Note>Cascade can make up to 25 tool calls per prompt. If the trajectory stops, simply type in `continue` and Cascade will resume from where it left off. Each `continue` will count as a new prompt. </Note>


# Voice input

Use Voice input to use your voice to interact with Cascade. In its current form it can transcribe your speech to text.

<video autoPlay controls muted loop playsInline className="w-full aspect-video" src="https://mintcdn.com/codeium/qJj_RRojefb93yIg/assets/windsurf/cascade/voice-mode.mp4?fit=max&auto=format&n=qJj_RRojefb93yIg&q=85&s=b6881ef11385d4f05fa151e0808a9e78" data-path="assets/windsurf/cascade/voice-mode.mp4" />


# Revert to previous steps

# Real-time collaboration

A unique capability of Cascade is that it is aware of your real-time actions.

You no longer necessarily need to prompt with context on your prior actions, as Cascade is already aware.

Try making a manual change in the code editor, and then prompt Cascade to "continue my work"!


# Ignoring files

If you'd like Cascade to ignore files, you can add your files to `.codeiumignore` at the root of your workspace. This will prevent Cascade from viewing, editing or creating files inside of the paths designated. You can declare the file paths in a format similar to `.gitignore`.

## Global .codeiumignore

For enterprise customers managing multiple repositories, you can enforce ignore rules across all repositories by placing a global `.codeiumignore` file in the `~/.codeium/` folder. This global configuration will apply to all Windsurf workspaces on your system and works in addition to any repository-specific `.codeiumignore` files.



# Model Context Protocol (MCP)
Source: https://docs.windsurf.com/plugins/cascade/mcp



**MCP (Model Context Protocol)** is a protocol that enables LLMs to access custom tools and services.
An MCP client (Cascade, in this case) can make requests to MCP servers to access tools that they provide.
Cascade now natively integrates with MCP, allowing you to bring your own selection of MCP servers for Cascade to use.
See the [official MCP docs](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) for more information.

<Note>Enterprise users must manually turn this on via settings</Note>

## Adding a new MCP plugin

New MCP plugins can be added by going to the `Settings` > `Tools` > `Windsurf Settings` > `Add Server` section.

If you cannot find your desired MCP plugin, you can add it manually by clicking `View Raw Config` button and editing the raw `mcp_config.json` file.

When you click on an MCP server, simply click `+ Add Server` to expose the server and its tools to Cascade.

Cascade supports two [transport types](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/transports) for MCP servers: `stdio` and `http`.

For `http` servers, the URL should reflect that of the endpoint and resemble `https://<your-server-url>/mcp`.

We can also support streamable HTTP transport and MCP Authentication.

<Note>Make sure to press the refresh button after you add a new MCP plugin.</Note>

## mcp\_config.json

The `~/.codeium/mcp_config.json` file is a JSON file that contains a list of servers that Cascade can connect to.

The JSON should follow the same schema as the config file for Claude Desktop.

Here's an example configuration, which sets up a single server for GitHub:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "github": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"
      ],
      "env": {
        "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "<YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

It's important to note that for HTTP servers, the configuration is slightly different and requires a `serverUrl` field.

Here's an example configuration for an HTTP server:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "figma": {
      "serverUrl": "<your-server-url>/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

<Note>For Figma Dev Mode MCP server, make sure you have updated to the latest Figma desktop app version to use the new `/mcp` endpoint.</Note>

Be sure to provide the required arguments and environment variables for the servers that you want to use.

See the [official MCP server reference repository](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers) or [OpenTools](https://opentools.com/) for some example servers.

## Admin Controls (Teams & Enterprises)

Team admins can toggle MCP access for their team, as well as whitelist approved MCP servers for their team to use:

<Card title="MCP Team Settings" horizontal={true} icon="hammer" href="https://windsurf.com/team/settings">
  Configurable MCP settings for your team.
</Card>

<Warning>The above link will only work if you have admin privileges for your team.</Warning>

By default, users within a team will be able to configure their own MCP servers. However, once you whitelist even a single MCP server, **all non-whitelisted servers will be blocked** for your team.

### How Server Matching Works

When you whitelist an MCP server, the system uses **regex pattern matching** with the following rules:

* **Full String Matching**: All patterns are automatically anchored (wrapped with `^(?:pattern)$`) to prevent partial matches
* **Command Field**: Must match exactly or according to your regex pattern
* **Arguments Array**: Each argument is matched individually against its corresponding pattern
* **Array Length**: The number of arguments must match exactly between whitelist and user config
* **Special Characters**: Characters like `$`, `.`, `[`, `]`, `(`, `)` have special regex meaning and should be escaped with `\` if you want literal matching

### Configuration Options

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Option 1: Plugin Store Default (Recommended)" description="Leave the Server Config (JSON) field empty to allow the default configuration from the Windsurf MCP Plugin Store.">
    **Admin Whitelist Configuration:**

    * **Server ID**: `github-mcp-server`
    * **Server Config (JSON)**: *(leave empty)*

    ```json  theme={null}
    {}
    ```

    **Matching User Config (`mcp_config.json`):**

    ```json  theme={null}
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "github-mcp-server": {
          "command": "docker",
          "args": [
            "run",
            "-i",
            "--rm",
            "-e",
            "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN",
            "ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server"
          ],
          "env": {
            "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "ghp_your_token_here"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    This allows users to install the GitHub MCP server with any valid configuration, as long as the server ID matches the plugin store entry.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Option 2: Exact Match Configuration" description="Provide the exact configuration that users must use. Users must match this configuration exactly.">
    **Admin Whitelist Configuration:**

    * **Server ID**: `github-mcp-server`
    * **Server Config (JSON)**:

    ```json  theme={null}
    {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "--rm",
        "-e",
        "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN",
        "ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server"
      ],
      "env": {
        "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": ""
      }
    }
    ```

    **Matching User Config (`mcp_config.json`):**

    ```json  theme={null}
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "github-mcp-server": {
          "command": "docker",
          "args": [
            "run",
            "-i",
            "--rm",
            "-e",
            "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN",
            "ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server"
          ],
          "env": {
            "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "ghp_your_token_here"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    Users must use this exact configuration - any deviation in command or args will be blocked. The `env` section can have different values.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Option 3: Flexible Regex Patterns" description="Use regex patterns to allow variations in user configurations while maintaining security controls.">
    **Admin Whitelist Configuration:**

    * **Server ID**: `python-mcp-server`
    * **Server Config (JSON)**:

    ```json  theme={null}
    {
      "command": "python3",
      "args": ["/.*\\.py", "--port", "[0-9]+"]
    }
    ```

    **Matching User Config (`mcp_config.json`):**

    ```json  theme={null}
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "python-mcp-server": {
          "command": "python3",
          "args": ["/home/user/my_server.py", "--port", "8080"],
          "env": {
            "PYTHONPATH": "/home/user/mcp"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    This example allows users flexibility while maintaining security:

    * The regex `/.*\\.py` matches any Python file path like `/home/user/my_server.py`
    * The regex `[0-9]+` matches any numeric port like `8080` or `3000`
    * Users can customize file paths and ports while admins ensure only Python scripts are executed
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Common Regex Patterns

| Pattern         | Matches                   | Example                |
| --------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `.*`            | Any string                | `/home/user/script.py` |
| `[0-9]+`        | Any number                | `8080`, `3000`         |
| `[a-zA-Z0-9_]+` | Alphanumeric + underscore | `api_key_123`          |
| `\\$HOME`       | Literal `$HOME`           | `$HOME` (not expanded) |
| `\\.py`         | Literal `.py`             | `script.py`            |
| `\\[cli\\]`     | Literal `[cli]`           | `mcp[cli]`             |

## Notes

### Admin Configuration Guidelines

* **Environment Variables**: The `env` section is not regex-matched and can be configured freely by users
* **Disabled Tools**: The `disabledTools` array is handled separately and not part of whitelist matching
* **Case Sensitivity**: All matching is case-sensitive
* **Error Handling**: Invalid regex patterns will be logged and result in access denial
* **Testing**: Test your regex patterns carefully - overly restrictive patterns may block legitimate use cases

### Troubleshooting

If users report that their MCP servers aren't working after whitelisting:

1. **Check Exact Matching**: Ensure the whitelist pattern exactly matches the user's configuration
2. **Verify Regex Escaping**: Special characters may need escaping (e.g., `\.` for literal dots)
3. **Review Logs**: Invalid regex patterns are logged with warnings
4. **Test Patterns**: Use a regex tester to verify your patterns work as expected

Remember: Once you whitelist any server, **all other servers are automatically blocked** for your team members.

### General Information

* Since MCP tool calls can invoke code written by arbitrary server implementers, we do not assume liability
  for MCP tool call failures. To reiterate:
* We currently support an MCP server's [tools](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/tools) and [resources](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/resources), not [prompts](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/prompts).



# Memories & Rules
Source: https://docs.windsurf.com/plugins/cascade/memories



`Memories` is the system for sharing and persisting context across conversations.

There are two mechanisms for this in Cascade: Memories, which can be automatically generated by Cascade, and rules, which are manually defined by the user at both the local and global levels.

## How to Manage Memories

Memories and Rules can be accessed and configured at any time by clicking on the `Customizations` icon in the top right slider menu in Cascade. To edit an existing memory, simply click into it and then click the `Edit` button.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintcdn.com/codeium/d8O4q6w3H2CjrirL/assets/managing-memories-jb.gif?s=364abea59051eb01f19dbe91ba7bcf35" data-og-width="800" width="800" data-og-height="506" height="506" data-path="assets/managing-memories-jb.gif" data-optimize="true" data-opv="3" />
</Frame>

## Memories

During conversation, Cascade can automatically generate and store memories if it encounters context that it believes is useful to remember.

Additionally, you can ask Cascade to create a memory at any time. Just prompt Cascade to "create a memory of ...".

Cascade's autogenerated memories are associated with the workspace that they were created in and Cascade will retrieve them when it believes that they are relevant. Memories generated in one workspace will not be available in another.

<Tip>Creating and using auto-generated memories do NOT consume credits</Tip>

## Rules

Users can explicitly define their own rules for Cascade to follow.

Rules can be defined at either the global level or the workspace level.

`global_rules.md` - rules applied across all workspaces

`.windsurf/rules` - workspace level directory containing rules that are tied to globs or natural language descriptions.

## Rules Discovery

Windsurf automatically discovers rules from multiple locations to provide flexible organization:

* **Current workspace and sub-directories**: All `.windsurf/rules` directories within your current workspace and its sub-directories
* **Git repository structure**: For git repositories, Windsurf also searches up to the git root directory to find rules in parent directories
* **Multiple workspace support**: When multiple folders are open in the same workspace, rules are deduplicated and displayed with the shortest relative path

### Rules Storage Locations

Rules can be stored in any of these locations:

* `.windsurf/rules` in your current workspace directory
* `.windsurf/rules` in any sub-directory of your workspace
* `.windsurf/rules` in parent directories up to the git root (for git repositories)

When you create a new rule, it will be saved in the `.windsurf/rules` directory of your current workspace, not necessarily at the git root.

To get started with Rules, click on the `Customizations` icon in the top right slider menu in Cascade, then navigate to the `Rules` panel. Here, you can click on the `+ Global` or `+ Workspace` button to create new rules at either the global or workspace level, respectively.

<Tip>You can find example rule templates curated by the Windsurf team at [https://windsurf.com/editor/directory](https://windsurf.com/editor/directory) to help you get started.</Tip>

Rules files are limited to 12000 characters each.

### Best Practices

To help Cascade follow your rules effectively, follow these best practices:

* Keep rules simple, concise, and specific. Rules that are too long or vague may confuse Cascade.
* There's no need to add generic rules (e.g. "write good code"), as these are already baked into Cascade's training data.
* Format your rules using bullet points, numbered lists, and markdown. These are easier for Cascade to follow compared to a long paragraph.

For example:

```

# Coding Guidelines 
- My project's programming language is python
- Use early returns when possible
- Always add documentation when creating new functions and classes
```

* XML tags can be an effective way to communicate and group similar rules together. For example:

```
<coding_guidelines>
- My project's programming language is python
- Use early returns when possible
- Always add documentation when creating new functions and classes
</coding_guidelines>
```

In Cascade, you can easily switch between different models of your choosing.

Depending on the model you select, each of your input prompts will consume a different number of [prompt credits](/windsurf/cascade/usage).

Under the text input box, you will see a model selection dropdown menu containing the following models:

<ModelsTable />


# SWE-1.5, swe-grep, SWE-1

Our SWE model family of in-house frontier models are built specifically for software engineering tasks.

Our latest frontier model, SWE-1.5, achieves near-SOTA performance in a fraction of the time.

Our in house models include:

* `SWE-1.5`: Our best agentic coding model we've released so far. Near Claude 4.5-level performance, at 13x the speed. Read our [research announcement](https://cognition.ai/blog/swe-1-5).
* `SWE-1`: Our first agentic coding model. Achieved Claude 3.5-level performance at a fraction of the cost.
* `SWE-1-mini`: Powers passive suggestions in Windsurf Tab, optimized for real-time latency.
* `swe-grep`: Powers context retrieval and [Fast Context](context-awareness/fast-context)


# Bring your own key (BYOK)

<Warning>This is only available to free and paid individual users.</Warning>

For certain models, we allow users to bring their own API keys. In the model dropdown menu, individual users will see models labled with `BYOK`.

To input your API key, navigate to [this page](https://windsurf.com/subscription/provider-api-keys) in the subscription settings and add your key.

If you have not configured your API key, it will return an error if you try to use the BYOK model.

Currently, we only support BYOK for these models:

* `Claude 4 Sonnet`
* `Claude 4 Sonnet (Thinking)`
* `Claude 4 Opus`
* `Claude 4 Opus (Thinking)`



# Web and Docs Search
Source: https://docs.windsurf.com/plugins/cascade/web-search



Cascade can now intuitively parse through and chunk up web pages and documentation, providing realtime context to the models. The key way to understand this feature is that Cascade will browse the Internet as a human would.

Our web tools are designed in such a way that gets only the information that is necessary in order to efficiently use your credits.

## Overview

To help you better understand how Web Search works, we've recorded a short video covering the key concepts and best practices.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/moIySJ4d0UY" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen />

### Quick Start

The fastest way to get started is to activate web search in your Windsurf Settings in the bottom right corner of the editor. You can activate it a couple of different ways:

1. Ask a question that probably needs the Internet (ie. "What's new in the latest version of React?").
2. Use `@web` to force a docs search.
3. Use `@docs` to query over a list of docs that we are confident we can read with high quality.
4. Paste a URL into your message.

## Search the web

Cascade can deduce that certain prompts from the user may require a real-time web search to provide the optimal response. In these cases, Cascade will perform a web search and provide the results to the user. This can happen automatically or manually using the `@web` mention.

## Reading Pages

Cascade can read individual pages for things like documentation, blog posts, and GitHub files. The page reads happen entirely on your device within your network so if you're using a VPN you shouldn't have any problems.

Pages are picked up either from web search results, inferred based on the conversation, or from URLs pasted directly into your message.

We break pages up into multiple chunks, very similar to how a human would read a page: for a long page we skim to the section we want then read the text that's relevant. This is how Cascade operates as well.

It's worth noting that not all pages can be parsed. We are actively working on improving the quality of our website reading. If you have specific sites you'd like us to handle better, feel free to file a feature request!



# Workflows
Source: https://docs.windsurf.com/plugins/cascade/workflows



Workflows enable users to define a series of steps to guide Cascade through a repetitive set of tasks, such as deploying a service or responding to PR comments.

These Workflows are saved as markdown files, allowing users and their teams an easy repeatable way to run key processes.

Once saved, Workflows can be invoked in Cascade via a slash command with the format of `/[name-of-workflow]`

## How it works

Rules generally provide large language models with guidance by providing persistent, reusable context at the prompt level.

Workflows extend this concept by providing a structured sequence of steps or prompts at the trajectory level, guiding the model through a series of interconnected tasks or actions.

To execute a Workflow, users simply invoke it in Cascade using the `/[workflow-name]` command.

<Tip>You can call other Workflows from within a Workflow! <br /><br />For example, /workflow-1 can include instructions like "Call /workflow-2" and "Call /workflow-3".</Tip>

Upon invocation, Cascade sequentially processes each step defined in the Workflow, performing actions or generating responses as specified.

## How to create a Workflow

To get started with Workflows, click on the `Customizations` icon in the top right slider menu in Cascade, then navigate to the `Workflows` panel. Here, you can click on the `+ Workflow` button to create a new Workflow.

Workflows are saved as markdown files within `.windsurf/workflows/` directories and contain a title, description, and a series of steps with specific instructions for Cascade to follow.

## Workflow Discovery

Windsurf automatically discovers workflows from multiple locations to provide flexible organization:

* **Current workspace and sub-directories**: All `.windsurf/workflows/` directories within your current workspace and its sub-directories
* **Git repository structure**: For git repositories, Windsurf also searches up to the git root directory to find workflows in parent directories
* **Multiple workspace support**: When multiple folders are open in the same workspace, workflows are deduplicated and displayed with the shortest relative path

### Workflow Storage Locations

Workflows can be stored in any of these locations:

* `.windsurf/workflows/` in your current workspace directory
* `.windsurf/workflows/` in any sub-directory of your workspace
* `.windsurf/workflows/` in parent directories up to the git root (for git repositories)

When you create a new workflow, it will be saved in the `.windsurf/workflows/` directory of your current workspace, not necessarily at the git root.

Workflow files are limited to 12000 characters each.

### Generate a Workflow with Cascade

You can also ask Cascade to generate Workflows for you! This works particularly well for Workflows involving a series of steps in a particular CLI tool.

## Example Workflows

There are a myriad of use cases for Workflows, such as:

<Card title="/address-pr-comments">
  This is a Workflow our team uses internally to address PR comments:

  ```
  1. Check out the PR branch: `gh pr checkout [id]`

  2. Get comments on PR

   bash
   gh api --paginate repos/[owner]/[repo]/pulls/[id]/comments | jq '.[] | {user: .user.login, body, path, line, original_line, created_at, in_reply_to_id, pull_request_review_id, commit_id}'

  3. For EACH comment, do the following. Remember to address one comment at a time.
   a. Print out the following: "(index). From [user] on [file]:[lines] — [body]"
   b. Analyze the file and the line range.
   c. If you don't understand the comment, do not make a change. Just ask me for clarification, or to implement it myself.
   d. If you think you can make the change, make the change BEFORE moving onto the next comment.

  4. After all comments are processed, summarize what you did, and which comments need the USER's attention.

    ## Remote Development

    For JetBrains IDEs used in remote development environments, you need to use the separate "Windsurf (Remote Development)" plugin.

    ### Requirements

    * JetBrains IDE version 2025.1.3 or greater

    ### Installation Steps

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Install on Host">
        Open the `Plugins (Host)` menu in your JetBrains IDE. The shortcut for this is `⌘+,` on Mac and `Ctrl+,` on Linux/Windows. It is also accessible from the settings menu.
        Search for **"Windsurf (Remote Development)"** and install it.
        Restart your IDE when prompted.

      </Step>

      <Step title="Wait for Language Server">
        After installing the plugin on the host, Windsurf will begin downloading a language server.
        This is the program that communicates with our APIs to let you use Windsurf's AI features.
        The download usually takes ten to twenty seconds, but the download speed may depend on your internet connection.
        In the meantime, you are free to use your IDE as usual.

        You should see a notification on the bottom right to indicate the progress of the download.

    ## Install Windsurf Plugin

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Install Jupyter Extension">
        Open a new Jupyter Lab session. In a cell, paste and run `Shift+Enter` the following:

        ```python  theme={null}
        import sys
        !{sys.executable} -m pip install -U pip --user
        !{sys.executable} -m pip install -U codeium-jupyter --user
        ```

        If you’re inside a virtual environment, run:

        ```python  theme={null}
        import sys
        !{sys.executable} -m pip install -U pip
        !{sys.executable} -m pip install -U codeium-jupyter
        ```

        When the commands finish, close the notebook and stop the Jupyter server.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Launch Jupyter">
        Relaunch Jupyter and open a notebook. Open the settings (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>,</kbd>) and navigate to the **Windsurf** section. You’ll see fields for an enterprise URL and a token.

Windsurf Guide for Enterprise Admins


# Windsurf Guide for Enterprise Admins

> **Purpose**   This guide helps enterprise *platform / developer-experience* administrators plan, roll out, and operate Windsurf for organizations with **large enterprise teams**.  It is intentionally *opinionated* and links out to detailed "how-to" docs per topic.  Treat it both as a **read-through guide** *and* as a **check-list** when onboarding.

***

## 1.   Audience & Pre-Requisites

|                       | Details                                                                            |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Who should read**   | Platform / Dev-Ex admins, Corporate IT, Centralized Tooling teams                  |
| **Assumed knowledge** | Basic Windsurf terms (team, role), Enterprise IdP concepts (SAML, SCIM), CLI usage |
| **Out-of-scope**      | Deep security / compliance internals → see **Security & Compliance** docs          |

***

## 2.   Quick-Start Checklist

1. Confirm organization-wide settings
2. Set up **SSO** (Okta, Azure AD, Google; see SAML docs for others)
3. Enable **SCIM** & map IdP groups → Windsurf *teams*
4. Define **role** & **permission** model (least privilege)
5. Configure **Admin Portal**: team view & security controls
6. Distribute **Windsurf clients/extensions** to end users
7. View **analytics dashboards** & **API access tokens**

> Use this list as your "Day 0" deployment tracker.

***

## 3.   Core Windsurf Concepts

* **Team** – flat collections of members; no nested teams. Teams (also called *Groups*) drive **role assignment** and **analytics grouping**, letting you scope permissions and view usage metrics per cohort.
* **Roles & Permissions** – predefined RBAC; admins are primarily responsible for **team management**, **Windsurf feature settings**, and **analytics**. Built-in roles usually cover these needs, but creating a custom role with *analytics-view* permission lets team managers and leads see metrics for their own teams. (<a href="/plugins/accounts/rbac-role-management" target="_blank">RBAC docs</a>)
* **Admin Portal** – centralized UI for user & team management, credit usage, SSO configuration, feature toggles (<a href="/plugins/cascade/web-search" target="_blank">Web Search</a>, <a href="/plugins/cascade/mcp" target="_blank">MCP</a>, <a href="/windsurf/cascade/app-deploys" target="_blank">Deploys</a>), analytics dashboards/report export, service keys for API usage, and role/permission controls.
* **Agents & Workspaces** – Windsurf IDE and Jetbrains Plugins are Agentic

### 3.1   Admin Portal Overview

The Admin Portal provides centralized management for all Windsurf enterprise features through an intuitive web interface. Core capabilities include:

#### User & Team Management

* Add, remove, and manage users across your organization
* Configure teams with proper role assignments
* User status and activity monitoring

#### Authentication & Security

* Configure SSO integration with major identity providers
* Set up SCIM provisioning for automated user lifecycle management
* Manage role-based access controls (RBAC)
* Create and manage **service keys** for API automations with scoped permissions

#### Feature Toggles & Controls

> **Important:** These feature controls affect behavior for your entire organization and can only be modified by administrators. New major features with data privacy implications are released in the "off" state by default to ensure you have control over when and how they're enabled.

The <a href="https://windsurf.com/team/settings" target="_blank">Admin Portal</a> gives you granular control over Windsurf features that can be enabled or disabled per team. **Data Privacy Note:** Some features require storing additional data or telemetry as noted below:

**Models Configuration**

* Configure which AI models your teams can access within Windsurf
* Select multiple models for different use cases (code completion, chat, etc.)

**Auto Run Terminal Commands** *(Beta)*

* Allow or restrict Cascade's ability to auto-execute commands on users' machines
* [Learn more about auto-executed commands](https://docs.windsurf.com/windsurf/terminal#auto-executed-cascade-commands)

**MCP Servers** *(Beta)*

* Enable users to configure and use Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers
* Maintain whitelisted MCP servers for approved integrations
* **Security Note:** Review operational and security implications before enabling, as MCP can create infrastructure resources outside Windsurf's security monitoring
* <a href="https://docs.windsurf.com/plugins/cascade/mcp#model-context-protocol-mcp" target="_blank">Learn more about Model Context Protocol (MCP)</a>
* <a href="https://docs.windsurf.com/plugins/cascade/mcp#admin-controls-teams-%26-enterprises" target="_blank">MCP admin controls for teams & enterprises</a>

**App Deploys** *(Beta)*

* Manage deployment permissions for your teams in Cascade
* <a href="https://docs.windsurf.com/windsurf/cascade/app-deploys#app-deploys" target="_blank">Learn more about App Deploys</a>

**Conversation Sharing**

* Allow team members to share Cascade conversations with others
* Conversations are securely uploaded to Windsurf servers
* Shareable links are restricted to logged-in team members only
* <a href="https://docs.windsurf.com/windsurf/cascade/cascade#sharing-your-conversation" target="_blank">Learn more about sharing conversations</a>

**PR Reviews (GitHub Integration)**

* Install Windsurf in your team's GitHub organization
* Enable PR review automation and description editing
* <a href="https://docs.windsurf.com/windsurf-reviews/windsurf-reviews#windsurf-pr-reviews" target="_blank">Learn more about Windsurf PR Reviews</a>

**Knowledge Base Management**

* Curate knowledge from Google Drive sources for your development teams
* Upload and organize internal documentation and resources
* <a href="https://docs.windsurf.com/context-awareness/overview#knowledge-base-beta" target="_blank">Learn more about Knowledge Base</a>

## 4.   Identity & Access Management

> **Recommendation:** Use **SSO plus SCIM** wherever possible for automated provisioning, de-provisioning, and group management.

### 4.1   Single Sign-On (SSO)

|                          | Guidance                                                                                                               |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **IdPs supported**       | Okta, Azure AD, Google (others via generic SAML)                                                                       |
| **Recommended approach** | Create Windsurf-specific *app* in IdP; use **role-based** group assignments rather than org-wide `All Employees` group |
| **Common pitfalls**      | Email suffix mismatches, duplicate user aliases                                                                        |

*See the <a href="https://docs.windsurf.com/plugins/accounts/sso-scim" target="_blank">SSO & SCIM Setup Guide</a> for step-by-step configuration for Okta, Azure AD, Google, and Generic SAML.*

### 4.2   SCIM Provisioning

* **Why** – automated user lifecycle & team membership management at scale
* **Capabilities**
  * Create / deactivate **users** automatically
  * Create **teams** automatically (or manage manually)
  * Users can belong to **multiple teams**
  * Custom team creation via SCIM API (<a href="https://docs.windsurf.com/plugins/accounts/sso-scim#scim-api" target="_blank">docs</a>)
* **Mapping strategies**
  * 1 IdP group → 1 Windsurf team (simple, most common)
  * Functional vs. project-based group prefixes (e.g. `proj-foo-devs`)
* **Things to decide**
  * Which groups to *exclude* (e.g. interns, contractors)
  * Renaming rules when IdP group names change
* **Caution**: SCIM should remain your **source of truth**—mixing SCIM and manual / API updates can create drift. Use the API mainly for adding supplemental groups.

***

## 5.   User & Team Management at Scale

* Flat *team* → design team taxonomy carefully (no nesting to fall back on)
* Users can belong to **multiple groups**. Groups are used to view analytics
* Today, SCIM does not support assigning roles to users. SCIM only supports assigning users to Groups

***

## 6.   Analytics & API Access

### 6.1   Built-In Analytics

| Dashboard             | Use-case                                   |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Adoption Overview** | Track total active users, daily engagement |
| **Team Activity**     | Team usage                                 |

Analytics shows the **percentage of code written by Windsurf**, helping quantify impact—see your dashboards at <a href="https://windsurf.com/team/analytics" target="_blank">team analytics</a>.

### 6.2   APIs

| API      | Typical admin scenarios    |
| -------- | -------------------------- |
| **REST** | SCIM management, analytics |

* Generate service keys under <a href="https://windsurf.com/team/settings" target="_blank">**Team Settings → Service Keys**</a>. Scope keys to *least privilege* needed.
* More advanced reporting and usage management: see the <a href="https://docs.windsurf.com/plugins/accounts/api-reference/api-introduction" target="_blank">API Reference</a>.
* For team management: see the <a href="https://docs.windsurf.com/plugins/accounts/sso-scim#scim-api" target="_blank">SCIM API – Custom Teams</a>.

***

## 7.   Operational Considerations

* **Status Pages** – monitor live service health: <a href="https://status.windsurf.com/" target="_blank">Windsurf</a>, <a href="https://status.anthropic.com/" target="_blank">Anthropic</a>, <a href="https://status.openai.com/" target="_blank">OpenAI</a>
* **Support Channels** – windsurf.com/support

***

## 8.   Setting Up End Users for Success

1. Point end users to the <a href="https://docs.windsurf.com/plugins/getting-started" target="_blank">Windsurf installation guide</a> to install the appropriate extension or desktop client.
2. Publish an internal "Getting Started with Windsurf" page (link to official docs)
3. Hold live onboarding sessions / record short demos
4. Curate starter project templates & sample prompts
5. Collect feedback via survey after 2 weeks; iterate

# Tab
Source: https://docs.windsurf.com/tab/overview

A powerful next-intent prediction experience routed to a single keystroke.

**Windsurf Tab** has evolved from a simple autocomplete tool into a contextually aware diff-suggestion and navigation engine for writing code.

It is powered by SWE-1-mini, our in-house model trained from scratch to optimize for speed and flow awareness.

<Frame>
  <video autoPlay muted loop playsInline src="https://mintcdn.com/codeium/bVGscI7v3lPUsThV/assets/windsurf/tabdemo.mp4?fit=max&auto=format&n=bVGscI7v3lPUsThV&q=85&s=eb7a88258f63bdedb0895c79dc251ba4" data-path="assets/windsurf/tabdemo.mp4" />
</Frame>

Suggestions are based on the context of your code, terminal, Cascade chat history, your prior actions around the editor, and even your clipboard (must opt in via advanced Settings).

Tab is able to make edits *both before and after* your current cursor position. You can press `esc` to cancel a suggestion.

Suggestions will also disappear if you continue typing or navigating without accepting them.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

* **Accept suggestion**: `tab`
* **Cancel suggestion**: `esc`
* **Accept suggestion word-by-word**: `⌘+→` (VS Code), `⌥+⇧+\` (JetBrains)
* **Next/previous suggestion**: `⌥+]`/`⌥+[`

## Tab to Jump

Windsurf can also anticipate your next cursor position and prompt you with a `Tab to Jump` label at a certain line in the editor, allowing you to easily navigate through your file.

If you accept by simply pressing `tab`, then you will be taken to that next position.

<Frame>
  <video style={{ transform: 'scale(1.12)' }} autoPlay muted loop playsInline src="https://mintcdn.com/codeium/bVGscI7v3lPUsThV/assets/windsurf/tab-to-jump.mp4?fit=max&auto=format&n=bVGscI7v3lPUsThV&q=85&s=5985dadc5b900d497e55946d6f429c91" data-path="assets/windsurf/tab-to-jump.mp4" />
</Frame>

## Tab to Import

After defining a new dependency to use in a file, just simply hit `tab` to import it at the top of the file once the hint shows. Your cursor will stay in the same position.

<Frame>
  <video autoPlay muted loop playsInline src="https://mintcdn.com/codeium/vRt4FQOyBeZpD2Pu/assets/tab-import.mp4?fit=max&auto=format&n=vRt4FQOyBeZpD2Pu&q=85&s=9e1a5dce9a510ea50295228011d93eab" data-path="assets/tab-import.mp4" />
</Frame>

## Settings

Windsurf Tab is split up into two main configurable parts: Autocomplete and Supercomplete.

Autocompletes typically appear at your cursor, and Supercompletes appear either in small windows around your cursor, which can suggest both deletions and additions.

Autocomplete and Supercomplete can be toggled on and off. Autocomplete speeds can also be configured between Slow, Default, and Fast modes.

You can also opt-in to using your clipboard as context. This means if you copy something to your clipboard, Windsurf will be able to use it as context.

You can also toggle Tab to Import and Tab to Jump functionalities, and choose whether or not you want to highlight the code after an accepted Tab suggestion.

</Frame>

## Fill In The Middle (FIM)

Windsurf Tab can Fill In The Middle (FIM), meaning it can make suggestions while your cursor is in the middle of a line of code.

<Frame>
  <video autoPlay muted loop playsInline src="https://mintcdn.com/codeium/bVGscI7v3lPUsThV/assets/windsurf/inline-fim.mp4?fit=max&auto=format&n=bVGscI7v3lPUsThV&q=85&s=5526ce74678d75590b1c8182bcaa2125" data-path="assets/windsurf/inline-fim.mp4" />
</Frame>

Read more about in-line FIM on our blog [here](https://windsurf.com/blog/inline-fim-code-suggestions).

## Terminal Context Awareness

# Known IDE issues and solutions

## Codeium isn't starting

If Codeium isn't starting up, use the logs to debug what the cause could be (See above). If you are not able to resolve the issue, file a help request by submitting a ticket at help.codeium.com. Make sure to include the logs referenced above to help our team debug the issue as quickly as possible.

## Codeium Chat shows an empty screen

If you are using Windows 10, it's possible you need to install **WebView2** to switch the Eclipse web renderer from Internet Explorer to Edge.

You can see if this is the case by right-clicking --> `Properties` and seeing if there is an Internet Explorer icon.

## Certificate issue

This issue may be indicated by the following errors in the logs:

```
Failed to fetch extension version at <YourDomainURL>
javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: PKIX path building failed: sun.security.provider.certpath.SunCertPathBuilderException: unable to find valid certification path to requested target
```

Unlike other IDEs, Eclipse does not use the OS certificate store. You will have to load the certificates to the Java keystore.

* SaaS users will have to load the Codeium Github URL
* Self-hosted (On-prem) users will have to load their Codeium Enterprise domain URL as well as the Codeium Github URL

**Note**: This is an example for SaaS users, but the process is the same. *For enterprise users - Your certificate is issued and managed by your local IT or Admin team. Please reach out to them for assistance with installing the necessary certificates on your system.*

1. Export the certificate for [https://exafunction.github.io/](https://exafunction.github.io/) from the browser as `githubio.cer` file

In Chrome: navigate to the website, click the padlock, click `Connection is secure`, click `Certificate is valid`, go to the `Details` tab, press the `Copy to File...` button

2. Import in JDK/JRE keystore: (Need to run from cmd prompt opened with "Administrator" privilege)

```
keytool -import -noprompt -trustcacerts -alias codeiumgithub -file githubio.cer -keystore "%JAVA_HOME%/jre/lib/security/ cacerts" -storepass changeit
```

3. Verify that the certificate is added to the Keystore by executing:

```
keytool -list -keystore "%JAVA_HOME%/jre/lib/security/ cacerts" | findstr codeium
```

Enter the Keystore password.

4. Restart Eclipse and browse the marketplace extension from an internal browser. You should be directed to trust the unsigned content.

5. In some cases you might also need to pass the certificates path in VM arguments by editing your eclipse.ini file and adding the path:

```
-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore="path-to-your-certificates"
```



# JetBrains
Source: https://docs.windsurf.com/troubleshooting/plugins-enterprise/jetbrains




# Supported Versions

Version 2022.3 or greater.

* JetBrains Fleet or Reshaper are not supported
* Remote SSH is not supported.


# Gathering extension logs

Starting in extension version 1.10.0, the Chat Panel has an Extension Diagnostics button on the Settings page. This button will automatically collect relevant logs and parameters into a text file that can be downloaded.

For older versions of the extension:

1. Logs are written to the idea.log file. To locate this file, go to the `Help > Show Log in Finder/Explorer` menu option

2. Export or copy the logs


# Known IDE issues and solutions

## Cascade doesn't work (or Windsurf plugin doesn't work at all)

If the Windsurf JetBrains plugin isn't working, a good first step is to try and reset the plugin by going to `Help > Find Action > Reset Windsurf Enterprise Updater`.

If the issue is isolated to a few users, this is likely because the Enterprise Domain URL certificate is not loaded to your IDE. Your team's admin should know how to do this.

## Cascade not being displayed

Usually, you will see the following error in the logs:

```
JCEF is not supported in this env or failed to initialize
```

or

```
Internal JCEF not supported, trying external JCEF
```

JCEF is a browser needed to display Cascade. To fix this, go to `Help > Find Actions > Choose Java Boot Runtime` and pick a runtime with a bundled JCEF.
If you already have JCEF bundled as part of your runtime, JCEF may be disabled in your registry/properties.
Edit your properties: Help > Edit Custom Properties, add the following flag and restart your IDE:

```
ide.browser.jcef.enabled=true
```

## Certificate Issues

If you encounter the following errors:

```
Failed to fetch extension base URL at <YourDomainURL>
```

```
PKIX path building failed: sun.security.provider.certpath.SunCertPathBuilderException: 
unable to find valid certification path to requested target
```

This suggests that the Codeium extension is unable to trust the TLS connection to your enterprise portal / API server because it does not trust the certificate being presented. This either means that the certificate presented by the Codeium deployment is untrusted or a certificate presented by a corporate proxy intercepting the request is untrusted.

In either case, the most preferable solution is to ensure that the root certificate that signed this certificate is properly installed on end-user machines in the appropriate location. JetBrains IDEs and most other IDEs load certificates from the operating system's default location.

Your certificate is issued and managed by your local IT or Admin team. Please reach out to them for assistance with installing the necessary certificates on your system.

It is important that the full certificate chain is being presented from wherever TLS is being terminated. Oftentimes, if only the leaf certificate is presented, JetBrains IDE and other IDEs are unable to verify its authenticity because they are not aware of the intermediate certificate which validates the leaf certificate and is validated by the root certificate. Browsers are often able to work around this issue as users will likely have encountered a different website that does present the full certificate chain, so the intermediate cert is seen and cached, but applications like JetBrains IDEs don't have this advantage.

**Note**: In JetBrains family products **2024.3** a bug was introduced in which the IDE is failing to accept the OS certificates ([JetBrains issue report](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IJPL-171446/Unable-to-find-valid-certification-path-to-requested-target-exception-in-Settings-Sync-when-proxy-is-used)). To solve this, users can do any of the following:

* Downgrade JB products to earlier versions
* Use the 2024.3.1 preview version (beta version)
* Add `-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStoreType=Windows-ROOT` as a custom JVM option

## Custom Workspaces

If you see the following error when using Cascade:

```
Cascade cannot access paths without an active workspace
```

This indicates that Cascade needs access to a custom workspace to function properly. To resolve this:

1. Open your JetBrains IDE Settings by going to `File > Settings` (or `IntelliJ IDEA > Preferences` on macOS)

2. Navigate to `Tools > Windsurf Settings`

3. In the Windsurf Settings panel, locate the "Custom Workspaces" section at the bottom

4. Click the "Add Workspace" button to add your project workspace

5. Select the appropriate workspace directory for your project

6. Click "OK" to apply the settings

7. Restart your IDE for the changes to take effect

### Enterprise vs Non-Enterprise Behavior

The behavior of custom workspaces differs depending on your user type:

#### Enterprise Users

Enterprise users have selective control over workspace indexing:

* When adding workspaces, you'll see a checkbox option to enable indexing for each workspace
* Only workspaces with the checkbox enabled will be indexed and available to Cascade
* This allows you to control which workspaces consume indexing resources
* Tool calls are restricted to the active workspace for security

#### Non-Enterprise Users

Non-enterprise users get automatic workspace indexing:

* Any workspace you add is automatically indexed without requiring a checkbox
* All added workspaces are immediately available to Cascade
* Tool calls are never blocked outside the active workspace
* The selective indexing feature is not relevant under this model

After completing the setup steps above, Cascade should be able to access your workspace and function normally.



# Troubleshooting Checklist
Source: https://docs.windsurf.com/troubleshooting/plugins-enterprise/troubleshooting-checklist



Running into issues with Codeium? Use this checklist of common debugging techniques to try and resolve the issue, otherwise file a support ticket on help.windsurf.com.

## 1. Make sure the Codeium plugin has been installed properly

If you are a Codeium Enterprise user, make sure to follow the instructions that are available at your enterprise portal URL (https\://\[YOUR\_PORTAL\_URL]/install). Furthermore, remember to install the Codeium Enterprise Updater plugin, not the standard Codeium plugin. Finally, ensure that the enterprise portal url that you set in the plugin's settings is correct and formatted correctly (https\://\[YOUR\_PORTAL\_URL])

If you are on Teams or Codeium's free tier, follow the instructions outlined at windsurf.com/download.

In either case, make sure that your current IDE version is supported by Codeium.

## 2. Check Codeium's Feature Reference guide

If a particular feature is unavailable, it could be because it is not yet supported in your IDE. You can check which features are available on which IDEs using the feature reference guides linked below. Codeium is constantly expanding our coverage and striving to bring all features to all IDEs.

Codeium SaaS Feature Reference Guide

Codeium Self Host Feature Reference Guide

## 3. Try some common troubleshooting techniques

Sometimes a good old restart does the trick. Some things we recommend trying:

* *Try reloading your IDE*. Sometimes reloading the IDE fixes the issue. On JetBrains IDEs, you can try and reset the Codeium extension by going to `Help` --> `Find Action` --> `Reset Codeium`.

* *Try logging in and out of Codeium*. Enterprise users can sign out by navigating to their Enterprise Portal URL in the browser, clicking on their Profile icon, scrolling down to the bottom and clicking "Sign Out". Teams and free tier users can sign out by navigating to windsurf.com, clicking on their Profile icon, and selecting "Sign Out" from the dropdown menu.

* *Try uninstalling and reinstalling the plugin*. Sometimes conflicting plugins or IDE settings can cause issues that are resolved by simply removing the plugin and reinstalling it.

## 4. Look through the help center articles with fixes to common issues

We have documented issues that users commonly run into in the following help center articles. Be sure to look through these -- it's likely that someone has experienced the same issue as you!
