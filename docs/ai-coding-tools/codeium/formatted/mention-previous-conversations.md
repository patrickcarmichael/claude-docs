# @-mention previous conversations

You can also reference previous conversations with other conversations via an `@-mention`.

When you do this, Cascade will retrieve the most relevant and useful information like the conversation summaries and checkpoints, and specific parts of the conversation that you query for. It typically will not retrieve the full conversation as to not overwhelm the context window.
