# Revert to previous steps

You have the ability to revert changes that Cascade has made if you want to. Simply hover your mouse over the original prompt and click on the revert arrow on the right, or revert directly from the table of contents. This will revert all code changes back to the state of your codebase at the desired step.

<Warning>Reverts are currently irreversible, so be careful!</Warning>
