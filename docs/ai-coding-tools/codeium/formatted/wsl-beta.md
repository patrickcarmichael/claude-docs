# WSL (Beta)

As of version 1.1.0, Windsurf has beta support for Windows Subsystem for Linux. You must already have WSL set up and configured on your Windows machine.

You can access WSL by clicking on the `Open a Remote Window` button in the bottom left, or under `Remote-WSL` in the Command Palette.
