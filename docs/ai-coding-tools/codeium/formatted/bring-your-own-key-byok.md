# Bring your own key (BYOK)

<Warning>This is only available to free and paid individual users.</Warning>

For certain models, we allow users to bring their own API keys. In the model dropdown menu, individual users will see models labled with `BYOK`.

To input your API key, navigate to [this page](https://windsurf.com/subscription/provider-api-keys) in the subscription settings and add your key.

If you have not configured your API key, it will return an error if you try to use the BYOK model.

Currently, we only support BYOK for these models:

* `Claude 4 Sonnet`
* `Claude 4 Sonnet (Thinking)`
* `Claude 4 Opus`
* `Claude 4 Opus (Thinking)`
