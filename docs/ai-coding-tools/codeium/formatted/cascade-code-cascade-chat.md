# Cascade Code / Cascade Chat

Cascade comes in two primary modes: **Code** and **Chat**.

Code mode allows Cascade to create and make modifications to your codebase, while Chat mode is optimized for questions around your codebase or general coding principles.

While in Chat mode, Cascade may propose new code to you that you can accept and insert.
