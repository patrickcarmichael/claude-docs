# SWE-1.5, swe-grep, SWE-1

Our SWE model family of in-house frontier models are built specifically for software engineering tasks.

Our latest frontier model, SWE-1.5, achieves near-SOTA performance in a fraction of the time.

Our in house models include:

* `SWE-1.5`: Our best agentic coding model we've released. Near Claude 4.5-level performance, at 13x the speed. Read our [research announcement](https://cognition.ai/blog/swe-1-5).
* `SWE-1`: Our first agentic coding model. Achieved Claude 3.5-level performance at a fraction of the cost.
* `SWE-1-mini`: Powers passive suggestions in Windsurf Tab, optimized for real-time latency.
* `swe-grep`: Powers context retrieval and [Fast Context](context-awareness/fast-context)
