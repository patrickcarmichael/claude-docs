# Real-time collaboration

A unique capability of Cascade is that it is aware of your real-time actions.

You no longer necessarily need to prompt with context on your prior actions, as Cascade is already aware.

Try making a manual change in the code editor, and then prompt Cascade to "continue my work"!
