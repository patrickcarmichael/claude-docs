# Access to Tools

Cascade has a variety of tools at its disposal, such as Search, Analyze, [Web Search](/windsurf/web-search), and the [terminal](/windsurf/terminal).

It can detect which packages and tools that you're using, which ones need to be installed, and even install them for you. Just ask Cascade how to run your project and press Accept.

<Note>Cascade can make up to 25 tool calls per prompt. If the trajectory stops, simply type in `continue` and Cascade will resume from where it left off. Each `continue` will count as a new prompt. </Note>
