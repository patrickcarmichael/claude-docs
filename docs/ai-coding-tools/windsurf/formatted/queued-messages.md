# Queued Messages

While you are waiting for Cascade to finish its current task, you can queue up new messages to execute in order once the task is complete.

To add a message to the queue, simply type in your message while Cascade is working and press `Enter`.

* **Send immediately**: Press Enter again on an empty text box to send it right away.
* **Delete**: Remove any message from the queue before it's sent
