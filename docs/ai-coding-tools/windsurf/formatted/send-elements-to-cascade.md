# Send Elements to Cascade

In the Preview, you can select and send elements/components and errors directly to Cascade. Simply click on the "Send element" button on the bottom right and then proceed to select the element you want to send.

The selected element will be inserted into your current Cascade prompt as an `@ mention`. You can add as many elements as you want in the prompt.
