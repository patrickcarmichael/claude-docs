# In-IDE Preview

Windsurf can open a up a Preview as a new tab in your editor. This is a simple web view that enables you to view web app alongside your Cascade panel.

Because these Previews are hosted locally, you can open them in your system browser as well, complete with all the listeners and ability to select and send elements and console errors to Cascade.

<Warning>The listeners and the abilities to send elements and errors are optimized for Google Chrome, Arc, and Chromium based browsers.</Warning>
