# How It Works

When you're ready to commit changes:

1. Stage your files in the Git panel
2. Click the sparkle (✨) icon next to the commit message field
3. Review the generated message and edit if needed
4. Complete your commit

The AI analyzes your recent code changes and creates a meaningful commit message that describes what you've done.
