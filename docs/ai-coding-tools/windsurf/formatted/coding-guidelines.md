# Coding Guidelines 
- My project's programming language is python
- Use early returns when possible
- Always add documentation when creating new functions and classes
```

* XML tags can be an effective way to communicate and group similar rules together. For example:

```
<coding_guidelines>
- My project's programming language is python
- Use early returns when possible
- Always add documentation when creating new functions and classes
</coding_guidelines>
```
