# Tool Calling

Cascade has a variety of tools at its disposal, such as Search, Analyze, [Web Search](/windsurf/web-search), [MCP](/windsurf/mcp), and the [terminal](/windsurf/terminal).

It can detect which packages and tools that you're using, which ones need to be installed, and even install them for you. Just ask Cascade how to run your project and press Accept.

<Note>Cascade can make up to 20 tool calls per prompt. If the trajectory stops, simply press the `continue` button and Cascade will resume from where it left off. However, each `continue` will count as a new prompt credit due to tool calling costs.</Note>

You can configure an `Auto-Continue` setting to have Cascade automatically continue its response if it hits a limit. These will consume a prompt credit(s) corresponding to the model you are using.
