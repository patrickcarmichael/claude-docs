# Plans and Todo Lists

Cascade has built-in planning capabilities that help improve performance for longer tasks.

In the background, a specialized planning agent continuously refines the long-term plan while your selected model focuses on taking short-term actions based on that plan.

Cascade will create a Todo list within the conversation to track progress on complex tasks. To make changes to the plan, simply ask Cascade to make updates to the Todo list.

Cascade may also automatically make updates to the plan as it picks up new information, such as a [Memory](/windsurf/memories), during the course of a conversation.
