# Named Checkpoints and Reverts

You have the ability to revert changes that Cascade has made. Simply hover your mouse over the original prompt and click on the revert arrow on the right, or revert directly from the table of contents. This will revert all code changes back to the state of your codebase at the desired step.

<Warning>Reverts are currently irreversible, so be careful!</Warning>

You can also create a named snapshot/checkpoint of the current state of your project from within the conversation, which you can easily navigate to and revert at any time.
