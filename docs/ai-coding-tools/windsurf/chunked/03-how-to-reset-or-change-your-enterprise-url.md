# Known IDE issues and solutions

## e.split is not defined

You are using an unsupported VS Code version, please update to a supported version and try again. You can find a list of supported versions [here](/plugins/compatibility).

## Using the wrong API Server

If a user changes their API Server/Portal URL in their **workspace** settings, this will override their user settings and may result in an error where the extension is communicating with the wrong API server.

Make sure that your API Server/Portal URL is set correctly and not overridden accidentally by the workspace settings.

## Not seeing Codeium Chat responses

If you are trying to send messages to Codeium chat but not seeing responses, check if you can cancel the response. If you are unable to cancel the response, this means that the response was completed but not displayed. This can happen if the Chat Web Server loses connection to the extension. Reloading VS Code and opening the Codeium Chat panel again should show the responses.

## Unable to read file .../package.json

```
Unable to read file .../.vscode/extensions/codeium.codeium-<version>/package.json 
```

If the above error shows up in the Codeium logs, try deleting the extension folder (.../.vscode/extensions/codeium.codeium-\<version>) and reinstall the extension.

## VS Code Enterprise Updater Loop

"Codeium Enterprise Updated" every time you open VSCode, try restarting all extensions

1. Open the command palette ( CTRL + SHIFT + P )
2. Run 'Disable All Installed Extensions'
3. Run 'Enable all Extensions'
4. Restart VS Code

Make sure all extensions are enabled again.

## Enterprise updater doesn't install Codeium extension

The Enterprise updater is installed, but no extension is being downloaded or installed in VSCode. No extension logs option is available in VSCode output window drop down. The only available log you can see is:

```
[info] ExtensionService#_doActivateExtension Codeium.codeium-enterprise-updater, startup: false, activationEvent: 'onStartupFinished'
```

If you have previously disabled the Codeium extension and later uninstalled it, VSCode will not clear the disabled flag.

In order to do so manually:

1. Open the command palette ( CTRL + SHIFT + P )
2. Run 'Codeium Enterprise: Reset'
3. Select "Help" from the popup
4. Select "Show Disabled Extensions"
5. Re-enable your Codeium Extension

## Proxy / Network Issues

Unchecking `Detect Proxy` in Codeium settings in VSCode can sometimes resolve issues where the extension is incorrectly attempting to use a proxy.

## Certificate Issues

If you encounter the following errors:

```
ConnectError: [internal] unable to get issuer certificate
```

```
[ERROR]: [internal] unable to verify the first certificate
```

```
tls: failed to verify certificate: x509: "<yourdomainurl>" certificate is not standards compliant
```

This suggests that the Codeium extension is unable to trust the TLS connection to your enterprise portal / API server because it does not trust the certificate being presented. This either means that the certificate presented by the Codeium deployment is untrusted or a certificate presented by a corporate proxy intercepting the request is untrusted.

In either case, the most preferable solution is to ensure that the root certificate that signed this certificate is properly installed on end-user machines in the appropriate location. VS Code and most other IDEs load certificates from the operating system's default location.

Your certificate is issued and managed by your local IT or Admin team. Please reach out to them for assistance with installing the necessary certificates on your system.

It is important that the full certificate chain is being presented from wherever TLS is being terminated. Oftentimes, if only the leaf certificate is presented, VS Code and other IDEs are unable to verify its authenticity because they are not aware of the intermediate certificate which validates the leaf certificate and is validated by the root certificate. Browsers are often able to work around this issue as users will likely have encountered a different website that does present the full certificate chain, so the intermediate cert is seen and cached, but applications like VS Code don't have this advantage.

The Network Proxy Text VS Code extension is useful for debugging certificate issues.



# Gathering Logs
Source: https://docs.windsurf.com/troubleshooting/plugins-gathering-logs



If you're having issues, the first step in the troubleshooting process is to retrieve the logs from your IDE. Here's how you can get Windsurf logs for each of the major IDEs:

## JetBrains IDEs

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Local">
    Cascade has now the option to generate a diagnostics file directly from the IDE, there are 2 ways to do so:

    * In the Cascade window, click on the 3 dots in the upper right side, and select Download Diagnostics
    * In the IDE menu, go to Tools > Windsurf > Download Windsurf Diagnostics

    The first option is preferred since it also includes Cascade embedded browser logs.
    This button will automatically collect relevant logs and parameters into a text file.

    In extreme situations, you can always get the IDE full log (idea.log) from Help > Show Log in Explorer/Finder.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Remote">
    To gather the Windsurf diagnostics, you can use the following options:

    * In the Cascade window, click on the 3 dots in the upper right side, and select Download Diagnostics
    * In the IDE menu, go to Tools > Windsurf > Download Windsurf Diagnostics

    The first option is preferred since it also includes Cascade embedded browser logs.

    In addition, to collect the full IDE logs:

    * In the IDE menu, go to Tools > Windsurf > Collect Host and Client Logs
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## VS Code

1. Go to the Command Palette (`Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P` or go to View > Command Palette)

2. Type in "Show logs" and select the option that reads "Developer: Show Logs"

3. Change the dropdown in the top right that reads "Extension Host" and select "Windsurf"

4. You should see something similar to the image below:

</Frame>

5. Export or copy the logs

## Eclipse

In Eclipse, logs are written to the following paths:

* **Mac/Linux**: \~/.codeium/codeium.log
* **Windows**: C:\Users\<username>.codeium\codeium.log

## Visual Studio

Go to **view > output**, select "Windsurf" in the dropdown, and copy the logs.

## NeoVim

Set `g:codeium_log_file` to a path to a file in their vimrc and then relaunch vim.

Then the logs should be written to that file.

</Frame>

### On MacOS, I see a pop-up: 'Windsurf' is damaged and cannot be opened.

This pop-up is due to a false positive in MacOS security features. You can usually resolve this by going to "System Settings -> Privacy & Security" and clicking "Allow" or "Open anyway" for Windsurf. If this fails or is not possible, try the following steps:

1. Ensure that Windsurf is placed under your `/Applications` folder and that you are running it from there.
2. Check your processor type: if your Mac has an Intel chip, make sure you have the Intel version. If it's Apple Silicon (like M1, M2 or M3), make sure you have the Apple Silicon version. You can select the processor type from the [Mac download page](https://windsurf.com/windsurf/download_mac).
3. Try redownloading the DMG and reinstalling from [the official download page](https://windsurf.com/windsurf/download_mac), as the failing security feature is usually triggered on download.
4. Make sure Windsurf (and the "Windsurf is Damaged" pop-up) is closed, and run `xattr -c "/Applications/Windsurf.app/"`.

### I received an error message about updates on Windows, or updates are not appearing on Windows.

For example:

> Updates are disabled because you are running the user-scope installation of Windsurf as Administrator.

We cannot auto-update Windsurf when it is run as Administrator. Please re-run Windsurf with User scope to update.

### What domains should I whitelist for network filters/firewalls, VPNs, or proxies?

If you're using any network filtering, firewalls, VPN services, or working in environments with restricted network access, you may experience connectivity issues with Windsurf. To ensure smooth operation, please whitelist the following domains in your network configuration:

* \*.codeium.com
* \*.windsurf.com
* \*.codeiumdata.com

### On Linux, Windsurf quietly doesn't launch, or crashes on launch

This is usually due to an Electron permissions issue, which VSCode also has, and is expected when using the tarball on Linux.

The easiest way to fix it is to run the following:

```bash  theme={null}
sudo chown root:root /path/to/windsurf/chrome-sandbox
sudo chown 4755 /path/to/windsurf/chrome-sandbox
```

You should then be able to launch Windsurf. You can also just run `windsurf` with the flag `--no-sandbox`, though we don't encourage this.

If this fails, then try the below.

### I received an error message saying 'Windsurf failed to start'

<Warning>Warning: deleting these folders will remove your conversation history and local settings!</Warning>

Delete the following folder:

Windows: `C:\Users\<YOUR_USERNAME>\.codeium\windsurf\cascade`

Linux/Mac: `~/.codeium/windsurf/cascade`

and try restarting the IDE.

### I received an error message about updates on Windows, or updates are not appearing on Windows.

An example:

> Updates are disabled because you are running the user-scope installation of Windsurf as Administrator.

We cannot auto-update Windsurf when it is run as Administrator. Please re-run Windsurf with User scope to update.

### My Cascade panel goes blank

Please reach out to us if this happens! A screen recording would be much appreciated. This can often be solved by clearing your chat history (`~/.codeium/windsurf/cascade`).

  <img src="https://mintcdn.com/codeium/d8O4q6w3H2CjrirL/assets/external-apps/github-bot-pr.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=d8O4q6w3H2CjrirL&q=85&s=b1e100ae9ff71de84cf1b2b939db8e12" data-og-width="2120" width="2120" data-og-height="1156" height="1156" data-path="assets/external-apps/github-bot-pr.png" data-optimize="true" data-opv="3" srcset="https://mintcdn.com/codeium/d8O4q6w3H2CjrirL/assets/external-apps/github-bot-pr.png?w=280&fit=max&auto=format&n=d8O4q6w3H2CjrirL&q=85&s=cd92e04121f32251117b939eaa666b2d 280w, https://mintcdn.com/codeium/d8O4q6w3H2CjrirL/assets/external-apps/github-bot-pr.png?w=560&fit=max&auto=format&n=d8O4q6w3H2CjrirL&q=85&s=c8f9c2350fa281444d6a3337fae74ea1 560w, https://mintcdn.com/codeium/d8O4q6w3H2CjrirL/assets/external-apps/github-bot-pr.png?w=840&fit=max&auto=format&n=d8O4q6w3H2CjrirL&q=85&s=5ef52c4a1e831b14885aa116054c0075 840w, https://mintcdn.com/codeium/d8O4q6w3H2CjrirL/assets/external-apps/github-bot-pr.png?w=1100&fit=max&auto=format&n=d8O4q6w3H2CjrirL&q=85&s=e1d052ca684b4ca413b15eb871d1666c 1100w, https://mintcdn.com/codeium/d8O4q6w3H2CjrirL/assets/external-apps/github-bot-pr.png?w=1650&fit=max&auto=format&n=d8O4q6w3H2CjrirL&q=85&s=4548978dd7d615103c1dc2778ecea0ee 1650w, https://mintcdn.com/codeium/d8O4q6w3H2CjrirL/assets/external-apps/github-bot-pr.png?w=2500&fit=max&auto=format&n=d8O4q6w3H2CjrirL&q=85&s=0eed14d8f1f05325371337e5f3a9068a 2500w" />
</Frame>

## How It Works

Once enabled, Windsurf automatically reviews eligible pull requests in selected repositories and provides feedback as GitHub review comments.

Reviews can be manually triggered when you mark a PR as “ready for review” or you type `/windsurf-review` in a PR comment.

You can also edit a PR title by typing `/windsurf` into the PR title.

Example workflow:

1. Developer opens a pull request in an enabled repository
2. Developer marks the PR as ready for review or types “@windsurf /review” in a PR comment
3. Windsurf reviews the PR and posts feedback as GitHub review comments
4. Developer addresses feedback and updates the PR

<Note>Limitations: 50 files per PR and Organization-wide limit of 500 reviews/month.</Note>

## Setup

An organization admin must connect the Windsurf GitHub bot to your GitHub Cloud organization to enable Windsurf PR Reviews:

1. Navigate to the Windsurf Team Settings page and click on Github Integration, or click [here](https://windsurf.com/team/settings)
2. During installation on the Github side, select which repositories to enable for PR reviews
3. Back in the Windsurf settings, configure toggles for allowing reviews/edits, define PR Guidelines for Reviews and Descriptions
4. All users in the organization can then receive PR reviews on their pull requests

<Warning>Reviews are not triggered on draft pull requests.</Warning>

## Disabling PR Reviews

To disable Windsurf PR Reviews, disconnect the Windsurf GitHub bot from your organization or remove it from specific repositories via GitHub settings.

## Best Practices

For effective PR reviews:

* Use natural language in PR Guidelines
* Don't be too vague about the purpose of your changes
* Include detailed examples where helpful

## Important Notes

* PCW (Percent Code Written) has high variance within single days or users - aggregate over weeks for better insights
* All selection fields must either have aggregation functions or none should (cannot mix)
* Fields with "distinct\_\*" pattern cannot be used in aggregations
* Field aliases must be unique across all selections and aggregations
* If no aggregation function is specified, it defaults to UNSPECIFIED

Common error messages and debugging tips for the Analytics API

## Overview

The Analytics API returns detailed error messages to help debug invalid queries. This page covers common error scenarios and how to resolve them.

## Error Response Format

When an error occurs, the API returns an error response with a descriptive message:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "error": "Error message describing what went wrong"
}
```

## Common Errors

### Authentication Errors

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Invalid service key">
    **Error:** `Invalid service key`

    **Cause:** The provided service key is not valid or has been revoked.

    **Solution:**

    * Verify your service key is correct
    * Check that the service key hasn't been revoked
    * Generate a new service key if needed
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Insufficient permissions">
    **Error:** `Insufficient permissions`

    **Cause:** The service key doesn't have the required "Teams Read-only" permissions.

    **Solution:**

    * Update the service key permissions in team settings
    * Ensure the service key has "Teams Read-only" access
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Query Structure Errors

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Missing selections">
    **Error:** `at least one field or aggregation is required`

    **Cause:** The query request doesn't contain any selections or aggregations.

    **Solution:** Add at least one selection to your query request:

    ```json  theme={null}
    "selections": [
      {
        "field": "num_acceptances",
        "aggregation_function": "QUERY_AGGREGATION_SUM"
      }
    ]
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Invalid data source">
    **Error:** `invalid query table: QUERY_DATA_SOURCE_UNSPECIFIED`

    **Cause:** There's likely a typo in the `data_source` field.

    **Solution:** Double-check the spelling of your data source. Valid options:

    * `QUERY_DATA_SOURCE_USER_DATA`
    * `QUERY_DATA_SOURCE_CHAT_DATA`
    * `QUERY_DATA_SOURCE_COMMAND_DATA`
    * `QUERY_DATA_SOURCE_PCW_DATA`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Mixed aggregation functions">
    **Error:** `all selection fields should have an aggregation function, or none of them should`

    **Cause:** Some selections have aggregation functions while others don't.

    **Solution:** Either add aggregation functions to all selections or remove them from all:

    **Invalid:**

    ```json  theme={null}
    "selections": [
      {
        "field": "num_acceptances",
        "aggregation_function": "QUERY_AGGREGATION_SUM"
      },
      {
        "field": "num_lines_accepted",
        "aggregation_function": "QUERY_AGGREGATION_UNSPECIFIED"
      }
    ]
    ```

    **Valid:**

    ```json  theme={null}
    "selections": [
      {
        "field": "num_acceptances",
        "aggregation_function": "QUERY_AGGREGATION_SUM"
      },
      {
        "field": "num_lines_accepted",
        "aggregation_function": "QUERY_AGGREGATION_SUM"
      }
    ]
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Field and Aggregation Errors

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Invalid aggregation function">
    **Error:** `invalid aggregation function for string type field ide: QUERY_AGGREGATION_SUM`

    **Cause:** The aggregation function is not supported for the specified field type.

    **Solution:** Check the [Available Fields](/windsurf/accounts/api-reference/custom-analytics#available-fields) section to see which aggregation functions are valid for each field. String fields typically only support `COUNT` and `UNSPECIFIED`.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Distinct field aggregation">
    **Error:** `tried to aggregate on a distinct field: distinct_developer_days. Consider aggregating on the non-distinct fields instead: [api_key date]`

    **Cause:** Fields with the "distinct\_\*" pattern cannot be used in the aggregations section.

    **Solution:** Use the suggested alternative fields for aggregation:

    **Invalid:**

    ```json  theme={null}
    "aggregations": [
      {
        "field": "distinct_developer_days",
        "name": "distinct_developer_days"
      }
    ]
    ```

    **Valid:**

    ```json  theme={null}
    "aggregations": [
      {
        "field": "api_key",
        "name": "api_key"
      },
      {
        "field": "date",
        "name": "date"
      }
    ]
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Duplicate field aliases">
    **Error:** `duplicate field alias for selection/aggregation: num_acceptances`

    **Cause:** Multiple selections or aggregations have the same name.

    **Solution:** Ensure all field aliases are unique. Remember that if no name is specified, it defaults to `{aggregation_function}_{field_name}`.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Data Filtering Errors

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Invalid group name">
    **Error:** `invalid group name: GroupName`

    **Cause:** The specified group name doesn't exist in your organization.

    **Solution:**

    * Double-check the group name spelling
    * Verify the group exists in your team settings
    * Use the exact group name as it appears in your team dashboard
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Invalid timestamp format">
    **Error:** `invalid timestamp format`

    **Cause:** The timestamp is not in the correct RFC 3339 format.

    **Solution:** Use the correct timestamp format:

    ```
    2023-01-01T00:00:00Z
    ```

    **Valid examples:**

    * `2024-01-01T00:00:00Z`
    * `2024-12-31T23:59:59Z`
    * `2024-06-15T12:30:45Z`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Conflicting filters">
    **Error:** `Cannot use both group_name and emails parameters`

    **Cause:** Both `group_name` and `emails` parameters were provided in a Cascade Analytics request.

    **Solution:** Use either `group_name` OR `emails`, but not both:

    **Invalid:**

    ```json  theme={null}
    {
      "group_name": "engineering",
      "emails": ["user@example.com"]
    }
    ```

    **Valid:**

    ```json  theme={null}
    {
      "group_name": "engineering"
    }
    ```

    **Or:**

    ```json  theme={null}
    {
      "emails": ["user@example.com", "user2@example.com"]
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Rate Limiting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Rate limit exceeded">
    **Error:** `429 Too Many Requests`

    **Cause:** You've exceeded the API rate limit.

    **Solution:**

    * Wait before making additional requests
    * Implement exponential backoff in your client
    * Consider batching multiple queries into single requests where possible
    * Contact support if you need higher rate limits
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Debugging Tips

### 1. Start Simple

Begin with basic queries and gradually add complexity:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "service_key": "your_key",
  "query_requests": [
    {
      "data_source": "QUERY_DATA_SOURCE_USER_DATA",
      "selections": [
        {
          "field": "num_acceptances",
          "aggregation_function": "QUERY_AGGREGATION_COUNT"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Validate Field Names

Double-check field names against the [Available Fields](/windsurf/accounts/api-reference/custom-analytics#available-fields) documentation.

### 3. Check Aggregation Compatibility

Ensure your aggregation functions are compatible with the field types you're selecting.

### 4. Test Filters Separately

If your query isn't returning expected results, try removing filters one by one to isolate the issue.

### 5. Use Proper JSON Formatting

Ensure your JSON is properly formatted and all strings are quoted correctly.

# Domain Verification
Source: https://docs.windsurf.com/windsurf/accounts/domain-verification



Domain verification is the process of proving that your organization owns or controls a specific domain. This prevents spoofing or unauthorized use of your domain and enables secure organization-level features in Windsurf, such as SSO and user management.

In Windsurf, verifying your domain is required so that users with emails from your organization can be recognized and managed. The domain you need to verify should be the top-level domain of your users’ email addresses (for example, if your users log in with [name@company.com](mailto:name@company.com), you must verify company.com).

## How to verify your domain in Windsurf

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add your domain in the Windsurf portal">
    Enter the domain you want to verify (e.g., company.com). Windsurf will generate a unique verification token and TXT record.

    ⚠️ This token will only be shown once. Be sure to copy it before closing the window.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add the TXT record to your DNS settings">
    In your DNS provider’s management console, create a new TXT record with the value provided. For example:

    <Frame>
      windsurf-verification=\<your-verification-token>
    </Frame>

    * Name/Host: as specified in the Windsurf portal (often @ or left blank).
    * Value/Content: the exact token string shown in the portal.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click “Verify” in Windsurf">
    After adding the record, return to the Windsurf portal and click the Verify button to complete the process.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Done">
    If the TXT record is detected, your domain will be marked as verified.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>DNS changes can take up to 24–48 hours to propagate. If verification does not succeed immediately, wait a bit longer and try again.</Note>

## What happens after domain verification

Once your domain is verified, the following behavior will occur:

### For teams with SSO enabled

Any user with an email that ends in your verified domain will only be able to sign up for an account through your SSO integration. Other sign-up attempts (such as username + password or Google OAuth) will be redirected to your SSO portal. Users will be automatically added to your team without an additional approval process.

### For teams without SSO enabled

Users with an email that ends in your verified domain will still be able to sign up for an account using any available method. These users will be automatically invited to your team, but will need to be accepted by a team admin before gaining access.



# Role Based Access & Management
Source: https://docs.windsurf.com/windsurf/accounts/rbac-role-management

Configure and manage role-based access controls, permissions, and user management for your Windsurf team

Windsurf's Role-Based Access Control system provides granular, role-based access to enterprise resources, enabling administrators to assign permissions and roles dynamically for secure and efficient access management.

<Note>Role-based access features are available for Teams and Enterprise plans.</Note>

## Role Based Access Controls

Windsurf's role-based access system allows enterprise organizations to implement fine-grained access controls across all team resources. The system enables:

* **Granular Permission Management**: Control access to specific features and data based on user roles
* **Dynamic Role Assignment**: Administrators can assign and modify roles for individual users or user groups
* **Secure Resource Access**: Ensure users only have access to the resources they need for their responsibilities
* **Audit and Compliance**: Track user permissions and access patterns for security and compliance requirements

The role-based access system integrates seamlessly with Windsurf's existing authentication mechanisms, including SSO and SCIM, to provide a comprehensive security framework for enterprise deployments.

## Role Management

<Note>We are continually working to improve role management features and functionality.</Note>

Roles can be created and managed in the Windsurf admin console via the Settings tab. For Windsurf's SaaS offering, access the Settings tab at:

<Card title="Team Settings" horizontal={true} icon="gear" href="https://windsurf.com/team/settings">
  Manage roles, permissions, and team settings from the admin console.
</Card>

### Creating a New Role

  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Role">
    Enter a descriptive name for the role and select the appropriate permissions from the checkbox list.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save Role">
    Review your selections and save the new role. It will now be available for assignment to users.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Role Permissions

Windsurf provides two default roles out of the box:

* **Admin Role**: Includes all available permissions for complete system access
* **User Role**: Includes no permissions by default, providing a minimal access baseline

### Modifying Role Permissions

### Disable Windsurf Access Feature

For administrators who need access to team analytics and audit/attribution logging but do not wish to consume a license, Windsurf provides a "disable Windsurf access" feature.

To access this feature:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Manage Team">
    Go to the **"Manage Team"** tab in your team settings.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Edit User">
    Find the user you want to modify and click **"Edit"** next to their name.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Disable Access">
    In the user edit dialog, you can disable their Windsurf access while maintaining their administrative permissions for analytics and logging.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## User Groups

<Note>User Groups are available for Enterprise organizations with SCIM integration enabled.</Note>

For enterprise organizations, Windsurf offers the ability to split users into multiple user groups via SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management) integration. This feature enables:

* **Organizational Structure**: Mirror your company's organizational structure within Windsurf
* **Group-Based Analytics**: View analytics and usage data filtered by specific user groups
* **Delegated Administration**: Assign group administrators who can manage specific user groups
* **Scalable Management**: Efficiently manage large numbers of users through group-based operations

User groups are automatically synchronized with your identity provider through SCIM, ensuring that organizational changes are reflected in Windsurf's access controls.

## User Management

Windsurf's role-based access functionality allows administrators to assign roles to individual users or user groups, providing flexible access control management.

### Assigning Roles to Users

User role management is performed in the Windsurf admin console at [windsurf.com/team/settings](https://windsurf.com/team/settings).

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to User Management">
    Go to the team settings page and locate the user management section.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Find User">
    Scroll through the user list or use the search functionality to find the user you want to modify. Users can be sorted alphabetically by name, email, sign-up time, or last login.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Edit User Role">
    Click **"Edit"** next to the user's name to open the user management dialog.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Role">
    In the pop-out window, select the appropriate role from the dropdown menu.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save Changes">
    Confirm your selection and save the changes. The new role will be applied immediately.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Administrative Hierarchy

Windsurf's role-based access system recognizes different levels of administrative access:

* **Super Admin**: Users with the admin role in the "all users" group have complete system access and can modify any role or permission
* **Group Admins**: Administrators of specific user groups can only make role and permission changes within their assigned groups

This hierarchical structure ensures that administrative responsibilities can be delegated appropriately while maintaining security boundaries.

### User Sorting and Management

The user management interface provides several sorting options to help administrators efficiently manage large teams:

* **Alphabetical by Name**: Sort users by their display names
* **Email Address**: Sort users by their email addresses
* **Sign-up Time**: View users in order of when they joined the team
* **Last Login**: Sort by most recent activity to identify active users

These sorting options make it easier to find specific users and understand team engagement patterns.



# Setting up SSO & SCIM
Source: https://docs.windsurf.com/windsurf/accounts/sso-scim



This feature is only available to Teams and Enterprise users.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Google SSO">
    Windsurf now supports sign in with Single Sign-On (SSO) via SAML. If your organization uses Microsoft Entra, Okta, Google Workspaces, or some other identity provider that supports SAML, you will be able to use SSO with Windsurf.

    <Note>Windsurf only supports SP-initiated SSO; IDP-initiated SSO is NOT currently supported.</Note>

    Users who login to Windsurf via SSO will be auto-approved into the team.

    ### Caveats

    Note that Windsurf does not currently support IDP-initiated login flows.

    We also do not yet support OIDC.

  <Tab title="Azure SCIM">
    Windsurf supports SCIM synchronization for users and groups with Microsoft Entra ID / Azure AD. It isn't necessary to setup SSO to use SCIM synchronization, but it is highly recommended.

    You'll need:

    * Admin access to Microsoft Entra ID / Azure AD
    * Admin access to Windsurf
    * An existing Windsurf Application on Entra ID (normally from your existing SSO application)

    <Note>
      **Service Key Permissions Required**

      The service key used for SCIM provisioning must have the following permissions:

      * **Team User Read** - Required to read user and group information
      * **Team User Update** - Required to create and update users and groups
      * **Team User Delete** - Required to deactivate/delete users and groups

      You can create a custom role with these permissions or use an existing admin role that includes them.
    </Note>

    ## Step 1: Create a Role with SCIM Permissions

    Before setting up SCIM provisioning, you need to create a role with the required permissions.

    1. Go to [Windsurf Team Settings](https://windsurf.com/team/settings)
    2. Under "Other Settings", click **Configure** next to **Role Management**
    3. Click **Add Role** and name it "SCIM Provisioning"
    4. Add the following permissions:
       * Team User Read
       * Team User Update
       * Team User Delete
    5. Click **Save**

    ## Step 2: Navigate to the existing Windsurf Application

    Go to Microsoft Entra ID on Azure, click on Enterprise applications on the left sidebar, and then click on the existing Windsurf application in the list.

    Click on Save to finish, you have now enabled user and group syncing for SCIM. Only users and groups assigned to the application will be synced to Windsurf. Note that removing users only disables them access to Windsurf (and stops them from taking up a seat) rather than deleting users due to Azure's SCIM design.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Okta SCIM">
    Windsurf supports SCIM synchronization for users and groups with Okta. It isn't necessary to setup SSO to use SCIM synchronization, but it is highly recommended.

    You'll need:

    * Admin access to Okta
    * Admin access to Windsurf
    * An existing Windsurf Application on Okta (normally from your existing SSO application)

    ## Step 1: Navigate to the existing Windsurf Application

    Go to Okta, click on Applications, Applications on the left sidebar, and then click on the existing Windsurf application in the application list.

    ## Step 2: Enable SCIM Provisioning

    Under the general tab, App Settings click on Edit on the top right. Then tick the 'Enable SCIM Provisioning' checkbox, then click Save. A new provisioning tab should have showed up on the top.

    Now go to provisioning, click Edit and input in the following fields:

    SCIM connector base URL: [https://server.codeium.com/scim/v2](https://server.codeium.com/scim/v2)

    Unique identifier field for users: email

    Supported provisioning actions: Push New Users, Push Profile Updates, Push Groups

    Authentication Mode: HTTP Header

    For HTTP Header - Authorization, you can generate the token from

    * [https://windsurf.com/team/settings](https://windsurf.com/team/settings) and go to the Service Key Configuration
    * Click on Configure, then Add Service Key, and give your API key a name
    * Copy the API key, go back to Okta and paste it to HTTP Header - Authorization

    Click on Save after filling out Provisioning Integration.

    ## Step 3: Setup Provisioning

    Under the provisioning tab, on the left there should be two new tabs. Click on To App, and Edit Provisioning to App. Tick the checkbox for Create Users, Update User Attributes, and Deactivate Users, and click Save.

    After this step, all users assigned to the group will now be synced to Windsurf.

    ## Step 4: Setup Group Provisioning (Optional)

    In order to sync groups to Windsurf, you will have to specify which groups to push. Under the application, click on the Push Groups tab on top. Now click on + Push Groups -> Find Groups by name. Filter for the group you would like to add, make sure Push group memberships immediately is checked, and then click Save. The group will be created and group members will be synced to Windsurf. Groups can then be used to filter for group analytics in the analytics page.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="SCIM API">
    This guide shows how to create and maintain groups in Windsurf with the SCIM API.

    There are reasons one may want to provision groups manually rather than with their Identity Provider (Azure/Okta). Companies may want Groups provisioned from a different internal source (HR website, Sourcecode Management Tool etc.) that Windsurf doesn't have access to, or companies may finer control to Groups than what their Idendity Provider provides. Groups can thus be created with an API via HTTP request instead. The following provides examples on the HTTP request via CURL.

    There are 5 main APIs here, Create Group, Add group members, Replace group members, Delete Group, and List Users in a Group.

    ### Create Group

    ```
    curl -k -X POST https://server.codeium.com/scim/v2/Groups -d '{
    "displayName": "<group name>",
    "schemas": ["urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:Group"]
    }' -H "Authorization: Bearer <api secret key>" -H "Content-Type: application/scim+json"
    ```

    ### Add Group Members

    ```
    curl -X PATCH https://server.codeium.com/scim/v2/Groups/<group name> -d '{"schemas": ["urn:ietf:params:scim:api:messages:2.0:PatchOp"],
    "Operations":[
    {
    "op": "add",
    "path":"members",
    "value": [{"value": "<email 1>"}, {"value": "<email 2>"}]
    }]}' -H "Authorization: Bearer <api secret key>" -H "Content-Type: application/scim+json"
    ```

    ### Replace Group Members

    ```
    curl -X PATCH https://server.codeium.com/scim/v2/Groups/<group name> -d '{"schemas": ["urn:ietf:params:scim:api:messages:2.0:PatchOp"],
    "Operations":[
    {
    "op": "replace",
    "path":"members",
    "value": [{"value": "<email 1>"}, {"value": "<email 2>"}]
    }]}' -H "Authorization: Bearer <api secret key>" -H "Content-Type: application/scim+json"
    ```

    ### Delete Group

    ```
    curl -X DELETE https://server.codeium.com/scim/v2/Groups/<group name> -H "Authorization: Bearer <api secret key>" -H "Content-Type: application/scim+json"
    ```

    ### List Group

    ```
    curl -X GET -H "Authorization: Bearer <api secret key>" "https://server.codeium.com/scim/v2/Groups"
    ```

    ### List Users in a Group

    ```
    curl -X GET -H "Authorization: Bearer <api secret key>" "https://server.codeium.com/scim/v2/Groups/<group_id>"
    ```

    You'll have to at least create the group first, and then replace group to create a group with members in them. You'll also need to URL encode the group names if your group name has a special character like space, so a Group name such as 'Engineering Group' will have to be 'Engineering%20Group' in the URL.

    Note that users need to be created in Windsurf (through SCIM or manually creating the account) before they can be added to a group.

    ## User APIs

    There are also APIs for users as well. The following are some of the common SCIM APIs that Windsurf supports.

    Disable a user (Enable by replacing false to true):

    ```
    curl -X PATCH \
      https://server.codeium.com/scim/v2/Users/<user api key> \
      -H 'Content-Type: application/scim+json' \
      -H 'Authorization: Bearer <api secret key>' \
      -d '{
        "schemas": ["urn:ietf:params:scim:api:messages:2.0:PatchOp"],
        "Operations": [
          {
            "op": "replace",
            "path": "active",
            "value": false
          }
        ]
      }'
    ```

    Create a user:

    ```
    curl -X POST \
      https://server.codeium.com/scim/v2/Users \
      -H 'Content-Type: application/scim+json' \
      -H 'Authorization: Bearer <api secret key>' \
      -d '{
        "schemas": ["urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:User"],
        "userName": "<email>",
        "displayName": "<full name>",
        "active": true,
    }' 
    ```

    Update name:

    ```
    curl -X PATCH \
      'https://<enterprise portal url>/_route/api_server/scim/v2/Users/<user api key>' \
        -H 'Authorization: Bearer <service key>' \
        -H 'Content-Type: application/scim+json' \
        -d '{
          "schemas": ["urn:ietf:params:scim:api:messages:2.0:PatchOp"],
          "Operations": [
            {
              "op": "Replace",
              "path": "displayName",
              "value": "<new name>"
            }
          ]
       }'
    ```

    ## Creating Api Secret Key

    Go to [https://windsurf.com/team/settings](https://windsurf.com/team/settings). Under Service Key Configuration, click on Add Service Key. Enter any key name (such as 'Azure Provisioning Key') and click Create Service Key. Copy the output key and save it, you can now use the key to authorize the above APIs.

# Plans and Credit Usage
Source: https://docs.windsurf.com/windsurf/accounts/usage



Prompt credits are consumed whenever a message is sent to Cascade with a premium model. Every model has it's own credit multiplier with the default message costing 1 credit. You can view all available models and their associated costs on the [models page.](/windsurf/models)

Upon using all of your credits, select premium models will no longer be accessible; however, you will still be able to use several other models that we've made available for free.

## Plans

The [Free](#using-a-free-plan) plan includes:

* 25 prompt credits
* Unlimited Windsurf Tab
* Unlimited Previews
* 1 App Deploy per day

The 2 week [Pro Trial](#using-a-free-pro-trial) includes:

* 100 prompt credits
* Unlimited Windsurf Tab
* Unlimited Previews
* 10 App Deploys per day

The [Pro](#using-pro-plan) plan includes everything in Free, but with:

* 500 prompt credits
* Add-on prompt credits at \$10/250 credits
* All premium models

The [Teams](#using-teams-plan) plan includes everything in Pro, but with:

After upgrading, your paid plan will start immediately and you'll have access to premium models again. To learn more about the quotas and features per pricing plan, [click here](https://windsurf.com/pricing).

## Errors

If a user message is unsuccessful, prompt credits will not be consumed. For example, if Cascade attempts to write to a file but that file has unsaved changes, the operation will fail and it will not consume a credit.

## Viewing your usage

There are a few ways to view your usage.

Go to the Cascade usage directly by clicking on the overflow menu, and then selecting "Cascade Usage".

View the settings panel by clicking on "Windsurf Settings" on the status bar, followed by selecting the "Plan Info" tab.

You can also view it on your plan page at [windsurf.com/subscription/manage-plan](https://windsurf.com/subscription/manage-plan) after you're authenticated.

## Upgrading to a paid plan

To learn more about paid features or to upgrade to a paid plan, [click here](https://windsurf.com/subscription/manage-plan). Paid plans include Pro for individuals, Teams for organizations, and Enterprise for larger companies.

We accept all major credit cards, Apple Pay, Cash App Pay, Google Pay, Link, WeChat Pay, and Alipay. If you have a payment method not listed, please reach out to us at [support](https://windsurf.com/support). You may need to disable your VPN to view the relevant payment methods for your region.

## What happens when you run out of prompt credits?

If you no longer have prompt credits, you have two options:

* You can purchase additional prompt credits to continue using premium models

* You can use Write or Chat mode with the models that cost 0 credits!

## Automatic Credit Refills

We've introduced Automatic Credit Refills so that you no longer need to manually purchase additional credits. Under your plan settings page on the Windsurf website, you can specify a maximum amount of credits and other refill settings. The system will automatically "top-up" your credits as you start running low (below 15 credits).

Automatic Credit Refills are purchased in configurable increments (multiples of \$10 for Pro and \$40 for Teams) and subject to maximum monthly budget caps (\$50 by default for Pro users and \$160 for Teams users). This ensures you won't lose access to Cascade during critical work.

## Purchasing additional credits

If you run out of prompt credits, you can purchase additional credits in the [billing website](https://windsurf.com/plan). Additional prompt credits can be purchased at a rate of \$10 for 250 credits for Pro users.

For Team and Enterprise plans, additional credits are purchased within and treated as a pool amongst all members of the team at a rate of \$40 for 1000 pooled credits. Please contact your Teams admin to purchase more credits if you're on a team plan.

## Usage examples

To explain how credits work, here's a simple example:

When you send a message to Cascade with a premium model, 1 Prompt credit is consumed. It doesn't matter how many actions Cascade takes to fulfill your request - whether it searches your codebase, analyzes files, or makes edits - you only pay for the initial prompt.

This simplified system makes it much easier to predict and manage your usage. No more complicated calculations of flow actions or different credit types.

## Plan Usage

### Using a Free Pro Trial

The Pro Trial lasts for 2 weeks and includes unlimited Windsurf Tab, 100 prompt credits, Previews, and Deploys.

When you're on a Pro Trial, you'll have access to premium features! To get started, ask Cascade a question. In Write and Chat mode, Cascade is optimized to fully understand your codebase and leverages tool calls to assist you. By default, all of your requests will use premium models until you run out of credits.

After your trial period ends, you'll need to upgrade to a paid plan to continue using premium models.

If you don't upgrade during the Free Trial period, you'll be downgraded to our Free plan which includes 25 prompt credits per month.

### Using Pro Plan

The Pro plan costs \$15/month and includes:

* 500 prompt credits/month
* All premium models
* Previews
* App Deploys

Additional prompt credits can be purchased at a rate of \$10 for 250 credits.

While on Pro, you'll have access to a monthly quota of prompt credits. You can view how many credits you have remaining in the Windsurf Settings panel that's accessible in the status bar.

If you're running low on credits, Cascade will notify you so that you can purchase additional credits or enable Automatic Credit Refills. To purchase additional credits, visit the billing website and select "Purchase credits". The credits purchased will rollover to the following usage month if there are any remaining.

If you want to reduce your consumption of prompt credits, there are several available models that cost 0 credits!

In addition to prompt credits, Pro comes with unlimited Fast Autocomplete and unlimited premium model requests with Command.

### Using Teams Plan

The Teams plan costs \$30/user/month (up to 200 users) and includes:

* 500 prompt credits/user/month
* Everything in Pro, plus:
* Centralized billing
* Admin dashboard with analytics
* Priority support

Additional prompt credits can be purchased at a rate of \$40 for 1000 pooled credits.

The Teams plan has a seat cap of 200 users. Coming soon, there will be an option to add Access Control features for +\$10/user/month.

While on the Teams plan, each user will have access to a monthly quota of prompt credits. Unlike the previous system, base prompt credits are not pooled - each user has their own credit limit. However, purchased add-on prompt credits are pooled across the organization. You can view how many credits your team has remaining in the Windsurf Settings panel.

If your team is running low on credits, your administrator can purchase additional credits or enable Automatic Credit Refills. These add-on prompt credits purchased will rollover to the following usage month if there are any remaining.

### Using Enterprise Plan

The Enterprise plan costs \$60/user/month (up to 200 users) and includes everything in Teams plus:

* 1000 prompt credits/user/month
* Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
* SSO & SCIM (included)
* Longer model context lengths
* Highest priority support

Additional prompt credits can be purchased at a rate of \$40 for 1000 pooled credits.

Coming soon, Enterprise will be self-serviceable with month-to-month pricing. The Enterprise plan includes self-serve SSO integration and enhanced security features.

### Using a Free plan

The Free plan comes with:

* 25 prompt credits/month
* Unlimited Windsurf Tab
* Unlimited Previews
* 1 App Deploy per day

Windsurf can still be used for free after your credits are exhausted! There are several models available that cost 0 credits to use.

When editing code, you'll have access to unlimited Tab completions and AI command instructions. To learn more about features in Free and in paid tiers, [click here](https://codeium.com/pricing).

## Canceling your paid plan

As a paid individial user, you can cancel your plan at any time by browsing to the [windsurf.com/subscription/manage-plan](https://windsurf.com/subscription/manage-plan) page.
Upon canceling your paid plan, you'll still have access to all of your credits from your monthly quota and add-on prompt credits until the end of the usage month. After the usage month, all add-on prompt credits will expire and you'll be downgraded to the Free plan where you'll be provided a limited number of prompt credits.
If you change your mind and decide not to cancel before the end of the usage month, you can renew your plan by visiting the billing page.

For Teams or Enterprise plans, only the admin can cancel the plan, delete the team and remove users.



# Advanced
Source: https://docs.windsurf.com/windsurf/advanced



All advanced configurations can be found in Windsurf Settings which can be accessed by the top right dropdown → Windsurf Settings or Command Palette (Ctrl/⌘+Shift+P) → Open Windsurf Settings Page.


# Enabling Cascade access to .gitignore files

To provide Cascade with access to files that match patterns in your project's .gitignore , go to your Windsurf Settings and go to "Cascade Gitignore Access". By default, it is turned off. To provide access, turn it on by clicking the toggle.


# SSH Support

The usual SSH support in VSCode is licensed by Microsoft, so we have implemented our own just for Windsurf. It does require you to have [OpenSSH](https://www.openssh.com/) installed, but otherwise has minimal dependencies, and should "just work" like you're used to. You can access SSH under `Remote-SSH` in the Command Palette, or via the `Open a Remote Window` button in the bottom left.
This extension has worked great for our internal development, but there are some known caveats and bugs:

* We currently only support SSHing into Linux-based remote hosts.

* The usual Microsoft "Remote - SSH" extension (and the [open-remote-ssh](https://github.com/jeanp413/open-remote-ssh) extension) will not work—please do not install them, as they conflict with our support.

* We don't have all the features of the Microsoft SSH extension right now. We mostly just support the important thing: connecting to a host. If you have feature requests, let us know!

* Connecting to a remote host via SSH then accessing a devcontainer on that remote host won't work like it does in VSCode. (We're working on it!) For now, if you want to do this, we recommend instead manually setting up an SSH daemon inside your devcontainer. Here is the set-up which we've found to work, but please be careful to make sure it's right for your use-case.

  1. Inside the devcontainer, run this once (running multiple times may mess up your `sshd_config`):

  ```
  sudo -s -- <<HERE
  sed -i '/SSO SSH Config START/Q' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
  echo "Port 2222" >> /etc/ssh/sshd_config
  ssh-keygen -A
  HERE
  ```

  2. Inside the devcontainer, run this in a terminal you keep alive (e.g. via tmux):

  ```
  sudo /usr/sbin/sshd -D
  ```

  3. Then just connect to your remote host via SSH in windsurf, but using the port 2222.

* SSH agent-forwarding is on by default, and will use Windsurf's latest connection to that host. If you're having trouble with it, try reloading the window to refresh the connection.

* On Windows, you'll see some `cmd.exe` windows when it asks for your password. This is expected—we'll get rid of them soon.

* If you have issues, please first make sure that you can ssh into your remote host using regular `ssh` in a terminal. If the problem persists, include the output from the `Output > Remote SSH (Windsurf)` tab in any bug reports!


# Dev Containers

Windsurf supports Development Containers on Mac, Windows, and Linux for both local and remote (via SSH) workflows.

Prerequisites:

* Local: Docker must be installed on your machine and accessible from the Windsurf terminal.
* Remote over SSH: Connect to a remote host using Windsurf Remote-SSH. Docker must be installed and accessible on the remote host (from the remote shell). Your project should include a `devcontainer.json` or equivalent config.

Available commands (in both local and remote windows):

1. `Dev Containers: Open Folder in Container`
   * Open a new workspace using a specified `devcontainer.json`.
2. `Dev Containers: Reopen in Container`
   * Reopen the current workspace in a new container defined by your `devcontainer.json`.
3. `Dev Containers: Attach to Running Container`
   * Attach to an existing Docker container and connect your current workspace to it. If the container does not follow the [Development Container Specificaton](https://containers.dev/implementors/spec/), Windsurf will attempt best-effort detection of the remote user and environment.
4. `Dev Containers: Reopen Folder Locally`
   * When connected to a development container, disconnect and reopen the workspace on the local filesystem.
5. `Dev Containers: Show Windsurf Dev Containers Log`
   * Open the Dev Containers log output for troubleshooting.

These commands are available from the Command Palette and will also appear when you click the `Open a Remote Window` button in the bottom left (including when you are connected to a remote host via SSH).

Related:

* `Remote Explorer: Focus on Dev Containers (Windsurf) View` — quickly open the Dev Containers view.


# WSL (Beta)

As of version 1.1.0, Windsurf has beta support for Windows Subsystem for Linux. You must already have WSL set up and configured on your Windows machine.

You can access WSL by clicking on the `Open a Remote Window` button in the bottom left, or under `Remote-WSL` in the Command Palette.


# Extension Marketplace

You can change the marketplace you use to download extensions from. To do this, go to `Windsurf Settings` and modify the Marketplace URL settings under the `General` section.
