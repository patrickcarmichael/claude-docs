## Dive deeper into vision

Ready to start building with images using Claude? Here are a few helpful resources:

* [Multimodal cookbook](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-cookbook/tree/main/multimodal): This cookbook has tips on [getting started with images](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-cookbook/blob/main/multimodal/getting%5Fstarted%5Fwith%5Fvision.ipynb) and [best practice techniques](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-cookbook/blob/main/multimodal/best%5Fpractices%5Ffor%5Fvision.ipynb) to ensure the highest quality performance with images. See how you can effectively prompt Claude with images to carry out tasks such as [interpreting and analyzing charts](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-cookbook/blob/main/multimodal/reading%5Fcharts%5Fgraphs%5Fpowerpoints.ipynb) or [extracting content from forms](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-cookbook/blob/main/multimodal/how%5Fto%5Ftranscribe%5Ftext.ipynb).
* [API reference](/en/api/messages): Visit our documentation for the Messages API, including example [API calls involving images](/en/docs/build-with-claude/working-with-messages#vision).

If you have any other questions, feel free to reach out to our [support team](https://support.claude.com/). You can also join our [developer community](https://www.anthropic.com/discord) to connect with other creators and get help from Anthropic experts.
