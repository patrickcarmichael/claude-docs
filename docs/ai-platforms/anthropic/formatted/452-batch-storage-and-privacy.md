## Batch storage and privacy

* **Workspace isolation**: Batches are isolated within the Workspace they are created in. They can only be accessed by API keys associated with that Workspace, or users with permission to view Workspace batches in the Console.

* **Result availability**: Batch results are available for 29 days after the batch is created, allowing ample time for retrieval and processing.
