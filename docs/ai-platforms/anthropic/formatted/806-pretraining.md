## Pretraining

Pretraining is the initial process of training language models on a large unlabeled corpus of text. In Claude's case, autoregressive language models (like Claude's underlying model) are pretrained to predict the next word, given the previous context of text in the document. These pretrained models are not inherently good at answering questions or following instructions, and often require deep skill in prompt engineering to elicit desired behaviors. Fine-tuning and RLHF are used to refine these pretrained models, making them more useful for a wide range of tasks.
