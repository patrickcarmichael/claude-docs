## When to use the prompt improver

The prompt improver works best for:

* Complex tasks requiring detailed reasoning
* Situations where accuracy is more important than speed
* Problems where Claude's current outputs need significant improvement

>   **📝 Note**
>
> For latency or cost-sensitive applications, consider using simpler prompts. The prompt improver creates templates that produce longer, more thorough, but slower responses.
