## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

* **Examples not appearing in output**: Check that examples are properly formatted with XML tags and appear at the start of the first user message
* **Chain of thought too verbose**: Add specific instructions about desired output length and level of detail
* **Reasoning steps don't match your needs**: Modify the steps section to match your specific use case
