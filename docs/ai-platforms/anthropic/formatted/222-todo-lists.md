## Todo Lists

Track and display todos using the Claude Agent SDK for organized task management

Todo tracking provides a structured way to manage tasks and display progress to users. The Claude Agent SDK includes built-in todo functionality that helps organize complex workflows and keep users informed about task progression.

### Todo Lifecycle

Todos follow a predictable lifecycle:

1. **Created** as `pending` when tasks are identified
2. **Activated** to `in_progress` when work begins
3. **Completed** when the task finishes successfully
4. **Removed** when all tasks in a group are completed

### When Todos Are Used

The SDK automatically creates todos for:

* **Complex multi-step tasks** requiring 3 or more distinct actions
* **User-provided task lists** when multiple items are mentioned
* **Non-trivial operations** that benefit from progress tracking
* **Explicit requests** when users ask for todo organization
