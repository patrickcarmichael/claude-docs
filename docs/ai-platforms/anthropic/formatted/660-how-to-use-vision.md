## How to use vision

Use Claude’s vision capabilities via:

* [claude.ai](https://claude.ai/). Upload an image like you would a file, or drag and drop an image directly into the chat window.
* The [Console Workbench](https://console.anthropic.com/workbench/). If you select a model that accepts images (Claude 3 and 4 models only), a button to add images appears at the top right of every User message block.
* **API request**. See the examples in this guide.
