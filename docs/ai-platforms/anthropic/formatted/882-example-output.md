* Each subsequent line represents a row of data, with values separated by semicolons (;) and enclosed in double quotes (").
* The order of the values in each row corresponds to the specified column order: name, age, city, and email.
* Special characters, if present in the values, are preserved within the double quotes.

2. Open a text editor (e.g., Notepad, TextEdit, or any other plain text editor).
3. Paste the CSV data into the text editor.
4. Save the file with a .csv extension (e.g., data.csv).
