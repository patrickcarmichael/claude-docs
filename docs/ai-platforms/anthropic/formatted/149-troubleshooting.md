## Troubleshooting

### Plugin not loading

If your plugin doesn't appear in the init message:

1. **Check the path**: Ensure the path points to the plugin root directory (containing `.claude-plugin/`)
2. **Validate plugin.json**: Ensure your manifest file has valid JSON syntax
3. **Check file permissions**: Ensure the plugin directory is readable

### Commands not available

If plugin commands don't work:

1. **Use the namespace**: Plugin commands require the `plugin-name:command-name` format
2. **Check init message**: Verify the command appears in `slash_commands` with the correct namespace
3. **Validate command files**: Ensure command markdown files are in the `commands/` directory

### Path resolution issues

If relative paths don't work:

1. **Check working directory**: Relative paths are resolved from your current working directory
2. **Use absolute paths**: For reliability, consider using absolute paths
3. **Normalize paths**: Use path utilities to construct paths correctly
