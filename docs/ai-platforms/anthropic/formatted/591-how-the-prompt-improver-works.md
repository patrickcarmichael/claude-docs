## How the prompt improver works

The prompt improver enhances your prompts in 4 steps:

1. **Example identification**: Locates and extracts examples from your prompt template
2. **Initial draft**: Creates a structured template with clear sections and XML tags
3. **Chain of thought refinement**: Adds and refines detailed reasoning instructions
4. **Example enhancement**: Updates examples to demonstrate the new reasoning process

You can watch these steps happen in real-time in the improvement modal.
