## Establish key criteria

When choosing a Claude model, we recommend first evaluating these factors:

* **Capabilities:** What specific features or capabilities will you need the model to have in order to meet your needs?
* **Speed:** How quickly does the model need to respond in your application?
* **Cost:** What's your budget for both development and production usage?

Knowing these answers in advance will make narrowing down and deciding which model to use much easier.
