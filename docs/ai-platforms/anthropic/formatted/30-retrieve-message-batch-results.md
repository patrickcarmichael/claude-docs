## Retrieve Message Batch Results

Source: https://docs.claude.com/en/api/retrieving-message-batch-results

get /v1/messages/batches/{message_batch_id}/results
Streams the results of a Message Batch as a `.jsonl` file.

Each line in the file is a JSON object containing the result of a single request in the Message Batch. Results are not guaranteed to be in the same order as requests. Use the `custom_id` field to match results to requests.

Learn more about the Message Batches API in our [user guide](/en/docs/build-with-claude/batch-processing)

>   **⚠️ Warning**
>
> The path for retrieving Message Batch results should be pulled from the batch's `results_url`. This path should not be assumed and may change.
