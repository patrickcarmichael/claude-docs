## Spend limits

Each usage tier has a limit on how much you can spend on the API each calendar month. Once you reach the spend limit of your tier, until you qualify for the next tier, you will have to wait until the next month to be able to use the API again.

To qualify for the next tier, you must meet a deposit requirement. To minimize the risk of overfunding your account, you cannot deposit more than your monthly spend limit.

### Requirements to advance tier
