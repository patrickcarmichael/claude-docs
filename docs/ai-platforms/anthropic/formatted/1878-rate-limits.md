## Rate limits

Source: https://docs.claude.com/en/api/rate-limits

To mitigate misuse and manage capacity on our API, we have implemented limits on how much an organization can use the Claude API.

We have two types of limits:

1. **Spend limits** set a maximum monthly cost an organization can incur for API usage.
2. **Rate limits** set the maximum number of API requests an organization can make over a defined period of time.

We enforce service-configured limits at the organization level, but you may also set user-configurable limits for your organization's workspaces.

These limits apply to both Standard and Priority Tier usage. For more information about Priority Tier, which offers enhanced service levels in exchange for committed spend, see [Service Tiers](/en/api/service-tiers).
