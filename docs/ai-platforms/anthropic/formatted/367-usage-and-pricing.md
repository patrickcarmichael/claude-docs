## Usage and pricing

Code execution tool usage is tracked separately from token usage. Execution time has a minimum of 5 minutes.
If files are included in the request, execution time is billed even if the tool is not used due to files being preloaded onto the container.

Each organization receives 50 free hours of usage with the code execution tool per day. Additional usage beyond the first 50 hours is billed at \$0.05 per hour, per container.
