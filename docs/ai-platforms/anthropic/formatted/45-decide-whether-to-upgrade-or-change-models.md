## Decide whether to upgrade or change models

To determine if you need to upgrade or change models, you should:

1. [Create benchmark tests](/en/docs/test-and-evaluate/develop-tests) specific to your use case - having a good evaluation set is the most important step in the process
2. Test with your actual prompts and data
3. Compare performance across models for:
   * Accuracy of responses
   * Response quality
   * Handling of edge cases
4. Weigh performance and cost tradeoffs
