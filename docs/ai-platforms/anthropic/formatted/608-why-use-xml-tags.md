## Why use XML tags?

* **Clarity:** Clearly separate different parts of your prompt and ensure your prompt is well structured.
* **Accuracy:** Reduce errors caused by Claude misinterpreting parts of your prompt.
* **Flexibility:** Easily find, add, remove, or modify parts of your prompt without rewriting everything.
* **Parseability:** Having Claude use XML tags in its output makes it easier to extract specific parts of its response by post-processing.

>   **📝 Note**
>
> There are no canonical "best" XML tags that Claude has been trained with in particular, although we recommend that your tag names make sense with the information they surround.
