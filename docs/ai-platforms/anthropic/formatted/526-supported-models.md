## Supported models

Referencing a `file_id` in a Messages request is supported in all models that support the given file type. For example, [images](/en/docs/build-with-claude/vision) are supported in all Claude 3+ models, [PDFs](/en/docs/build-with-claude/pdf-support) in all Claude 3.5+ models, and [various other file types](/en/docs/agents-and-tools/tool-use/code-execution-tool#supported-file-types) for the code execution tool in Claude 3.5 Haiku plus all Claude 3.7+ models.

The Files API is currently not supported on Amazon Bedrock or Google Vertex AI.
