## Error recovery

When a streaming request is interrupted due to network issues, timeouts, or other errors, you can recover by resuming from where the stream was interrupted. This approach saves you from re-processing the entire response.

The basic recovery strategy involves:

1. **Capture the partial response**: Save all content that was successfully received before the error occurred
2. **Construct a continuation request**: Create a new API request that includes the partial assistant response as the beginning of a new assistant message
3. **Resume streaming**: Continue receiving the rest of the response from where it was interrupted

### Error recovery best practices

1. **Use SDK features**: Leverage the SDK's built-in message accumulation and error handling capabilities
2. **Handle content types**: Be aware that messages can contain multiple content blocks (`text`, `tool_use`, `thinking`). Tool use and extended thinking blocks cannot be partially recovered. You can resume streaming from the most recent text block.
