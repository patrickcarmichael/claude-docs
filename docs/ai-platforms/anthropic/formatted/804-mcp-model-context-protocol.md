## MCP (Model Context Protocol)

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs. Like a USB-C port for AI applications, MCP provides a unified way to connect AI models to different data sources and tools. MCP enables AI systems to maintain consistent context across interactions and access external resources in a standardized manner. See our [MCP documentation](/en/docs/mcp) to learn more.
