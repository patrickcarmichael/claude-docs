## Getting started

To use the memory tool:

1. Include the beta header `context-management-2025-06-27` in your API requests
2. Add the memory tool to your request
3. Implement client-side handlers for memory operations

>   **📝 Note**
>
> To handle memory tool operations in your application, you need to implement handlers for each memory command. Our SDKs provide memory tool helpers that handle the tool interface—you can subclass `BetaAbstractMemoryTool` (Python) or use `betaMemoryTool` (TypeScript) to implement your own memory backend (file-based, database, cloud storage, encrypted files, etc.).

  For working examples, see:

  * Python: [examples/memory/basic.py](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-sdk-python/blob/main/examples/memory/basic.py)
  * TypeScript: [examples/tools-helpers-memory.ts](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-sdk-typescript/blob/main/examples/tools-helpers-memory.ts)
