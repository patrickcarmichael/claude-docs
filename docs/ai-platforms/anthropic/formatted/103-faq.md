## FAQ

### How do I communicate with my sandboxes?

When hosting in containers, expose ports to communicate with your SDK instances. Your application can expose HTTP/WebSocket endpoints for external clients while the SDK runs internally within the container.

### What is the cost of hosting a container?

We have found that the dominant cost of serving agents is the tokens, containers vary based on what you provision but a minimum cost is roughly 5 cents per hour running.

### When should I shut down idle containers vs. keeping them warm?

This is likely provider dependent, different sandbox providers will let you set different criteria for idle timeouts after which a sandbox might spin down.
You will want to tune this timeout based on how frequent you think user response might be.

### How often should I update the Claude Code CLI?

The Claude Code CLI is versioned with semver, so any breaking changes will be versioned.

### How do I monitor container health and agent performance?

Since containers are just servers the same logging infrastructure you use for the backend will work for containers.

### How long can an agent session run before timing out?

An agent session will not timeout, but we recommend setting a 'maxTurns' property to prevent Claude from getting stuck in a loop.
