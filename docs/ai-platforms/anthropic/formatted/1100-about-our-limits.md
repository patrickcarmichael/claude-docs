## About our limits

* Limits are designed to prevent API abuse, while minimizing impact on common customer usage patterns.
* Limits are defined by **usage tier**, where each tier is associated with a different set of spend and rate limits.
* Your organization will increase tiers automatically as you reach certain thresholds while using the API.
  Limits are set at the organization level. You can see your organization's limits in the [Limits page](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/limits) in the [Claude Console](https://console.anthropic.com/).
* You may hit rate limits over shorter time intervals. For instance, a rate of 60 requests per minute (RPM) may be enforced as 1 request per second. Short bursts of requests at a high volume can surpass the rate limit and result in rate limit errors.
* The limits outlined below are our standard tier limits. If you're seeking higher, custom limits or Priority Tier for enhanced service levels, contact sales through the [Claude Console](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/limits).
* We use the [token bucket algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket) to do rate limiting. This means that your capacity is continuously replenished up to your maximum limit, rather than being reset at fixed intervals.
* All limits described here represent maximum allowed usage, not guaranteed minimums. These limits are intended to reduce unintentional overspend and ensure fair distribution of resources among users.
