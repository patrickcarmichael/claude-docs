## Model compatibility

Computer use is available for the following Claude models:

| Model                                                                      | Tool Version        | Beta Flag                 |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Claude 4 models                                                            | `computer_20250124` | `computer-use-2025-01-24` |
| Claude Sonnet 3.7 ([deprecated](/en/docs/about-claude/model-deprecations)) | `computer_20250124` | `computer-use-2025-01-24` |

>   **📝 Note**
>
> Claude 4 models use updated tool versions optimized for the new architecture. Claude Sonnet 3.7 ([deprecated](/en/docs/about-claude/model-deprecations)) introduces additional capabilities including the thinking feature for more insight into the model's reasoning process.

>   **⚠️ Warning**
>
> Older tool versions are not guaranteed to be backwards-compatible with newer models. Always use the tool version that corresponds to your model version.
