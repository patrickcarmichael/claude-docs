## Specifying client tools

Client tools (both Anthropic-defined and user-defined) are specified in the `tools` top-level parameter of the API request. Each tool definition includes:

| Parameter      | Description                                                                                         |
| :------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`         | The name of the tool. Must match the regex `^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]{1,64}$`.                                 |
| `description`  | A detailed plaintext description of what the tool does, when it should be used, and how it behaves. |
| `input_schema` | A [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) object defining the expected parameters for the tool.     |

<Accordion title="Example simple tool definition">
```JSON
  {
    "name": "get_weather",
    "description": "Get the current weather in a given location",
    "input_schema": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "location": {
          "type": "string",
          "description": "The city and state, e.g. San Francisco, CA"
        },
        "unit": {
          "type": "string",
          "enum": ["celsius", "fahrenheit"],
          "description": "The unit of temperature, either 'celsius' or 'fahrenheit'"
        }
      },
      "required": ["location"]
    }
  }
```
  This tool, named `get_weather`, expects an input object with a required `location` string and an optional `unit` string that must be either "celsius" or "fahrenheit".
</Accordion>

### Tool use system prompt

When you call the Claude API with the `tools` parameter, we construct a special system prompt from the tool definitions, tool configuration, and any user-specified system prompt. The constructed prompt is designed to instruct the model to use the specified tool(s) and provide the necessary context for the tool to operate properly:
```
In this environment you have access to a set of tools you can use to answer the user's question.
{{ FORMATTING INSTRUCTIONS }}
String and scalar parameters should be specified as is, while lists and objects should use JSON format. Note that spaces for string values are not stripped. The output is not expected to be valid XML and is parsed with regular expressions.
Here are the functions available in JSONSchema format:
{{ TOOL DEFINITIONS IN JSON SCHEMA }}
{{ USER SYSTEM PROMPT }}
{{ TOOL CONFIGURATION }}
```

### Best practices for tool definitions

To get the best performance out of Claude when using tools, follow these guidelines:

* **Provide extremely detailed descriptions.** This is by far the most important factor in tool performance. Your descriptions should explain every detail about the tool, including:
  * What the tool does
  * When it should be used (and when it shouldn't)
  * What each parameter means and how it affects the tool's behavior
  * Any important caveats or limitations, such as what information the tool does not return if the tool name is unclear. The more context you can give Claude about your tools, the better it will be at deciding when and how to use them. Aim for at least 3-4 sentences per tool description, more if the tool is complex.
* **Prioritize descriptions over examples.** While you can include examples of how to use a tool in its description or in the accompanying prompt, this is less important than having a clear and comprehensive explanation of the tool's purpose and parameters. Only add examples after you've fully fleshed out the description.

  <Accordion title="Example of a good tool description">
```JSON
    {
      "name": "get_stock_price",
      "description": "Retrieves the current stock price for a given ticker symbol. The ticker symbol must be a valid symbol for a publicly traded company on a major US stock exchange like NYSE or NASDAQ. The tool will return the latest trade price in USD. It should be used when the user asks about the current or most recent price of a specific stock. It will not provide any other information about the stock or company.",
      "input_schema": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "ticker": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "The stock ticker symbol, e.g. AAPL for Apple Inc."
          }
        },
        "required": ["ticker"]
      }
    }
```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Example poor tool description">
```JSON
    {
      "name": "get_stock_price",
      "description": "Gets the stock price for a ticker.",
      "input_schema": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "ticker": {
            "type": "string"
          }
        },
        "required": ["ticker"]
      }
    }
```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

The good description clearly explains what the tool does, when to use it, what data it returns, and what the `ticker` parameter means. The poor description is too brief and leaves Claude with many open questions about the tool's behavior and usage.
