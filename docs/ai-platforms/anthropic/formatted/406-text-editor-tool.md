## Text editor tool

Source: https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/tool-use/text-editor-tool


Claude can use an Anthropic-defined text editor tool to view and modify text files, helping you debug, fix, and improve your code or other text documents. This allows Claude to directly interact with your files, providing hands-on assistance rather than just suggesting changes.
