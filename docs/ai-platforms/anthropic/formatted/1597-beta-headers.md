## Beta headers

Source: https://docs.claude.com/en/api/beta-headers

Documentation for using beta headers with the Claude API

Beta headers allow you to access experimental features and new model capabilities before they become part of the standard API.

These features are subject to change and may be modified or removed in future releases.

>   **ℹ️ Info**
>
> Beta headers are often used in conjunction with the [beta namespace in the client SDKs](/en/api/client-sdks#beta-namespace-in-client-sdks)
