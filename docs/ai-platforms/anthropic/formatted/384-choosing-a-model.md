## Choosing a model

We recommend using the latest Claude Sonnet (4.5) or Claude Opus (4.1) model for complex tools and ambiguous queries; they handle multiple tools better and seek clarification when needed.

Use Claude Haiku models for straightforward tools, but note they may infer missing parameters.

<Tip>
  If using Claude with tool use and extended thinking, refer to our guide [here](/en/docs/build-with-claude/extended-thinking) for more information.
