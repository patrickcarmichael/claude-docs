## Prompt and output performance

Claude 4 models excel in:

* **Performance**: Top-tier results in reasoning, coding, multilingual tasks, long-context handling, honesty, and image processing. See the [Claude 4 blog post](http://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-4) for more information.
* **Engaging responses**: Claude models are ideal for applications that require rich, human-like interactions.

  * If you prefer more concise responses, you can adjust your prompts to guide the model toward the desired output length. Refer to our [prompt engineering guides](/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering) for details.
  * For specific Claude 4 prompting best practices, see our [Claude 4 best practices guide](/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/claude-4-best-practices).
* **Output quality**: When migrating from previous model generations to Claude 4, you may notice larger improvements in overall performance.
