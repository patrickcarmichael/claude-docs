## Next steps

Here are some ideas for how to use the text editor tool in more convenient and powerful ways:

* **Integrate with your development workflow**: Build the text editor tool into your development tools or IDE
* **Create a code review system**: Have Claude review your code and make improvements
* **Build a debugging assistant**: Create a system where Claude can help you diagnose and fix issues in your code
* **Implement file format conversion**: Let Claude help you convert files from one format to another
* **Automate documentation**: Set up workflows for Claude to automatically document your code

As you build applications with the text editor tool, we're excited to see how you leverage Claude's capabilities to enhance your development workflow and productivity.
