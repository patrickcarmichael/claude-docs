## Accessing usage and cost reports

To access usage and cost reports for your organization, use the Usage and Cost API endpoints:

* The [**Usage endpoint**](/en/docs/build-with-claude/usage-cost-api#usage-api) (`/v1/organizations/usage_report/messages`) provides detailed usage data, including token counts and request metrics, grouped by various dimensions such as workspace, user, and model.
* The [**Cost endpoint**](/en/docs/build-with-claude/usage-cost-api#cost-api) (`/v1/organizations/cost_report`) provides cost data associated with your organization's usage, allowing you to track expenses and allocate costs by workspace or description.

These endpoints provide detailed insights into your organization's usage and associated costs.
