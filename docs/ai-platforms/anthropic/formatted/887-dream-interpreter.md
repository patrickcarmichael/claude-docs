| User   | I had a dream last night that I was walking through a dense forest. The trees were tall and dark, and I could hear strange whispers coming from the shadows. Suddenly, I stumbled upon a clearing where I found a majestic white stag standing in the center. As I approached the stag, it transformed into a wise old man who handed me a golden key. Then I woke up. What could this dream mean? |
