## Activity logging

Vertex provides a [request-response logging service](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/multimodal/request-response-logging) that allows customers to log the prompts and completions associated with your usage.

Anthropic recommends that you log your activity on at least a 30-day rolling basis in order to understand your activity and investigate any potential misuse.

>   **📝 Note**
>
> Turning on this service does not give Google or Anthropic any access to your content.
