* **Invalid file type (400):** The file type doesn't match the content block type (e.g., using an image file in a document block)
* **Exceeds context window size (400):** The file is larger than the context window size (e.g. using a 500 MB plaintext file in a `/v1/messages` request)
* **Invalid filename (400):** Filename doesn't meet the length requirements (1-255 characters) or contains forbidden characters (`<`, `>`, `:`, `"`, `|`, `?`, `*`, `\`, `/`, or unicode characters 0-31)
* **File too large (413):** File exceeds the 500 MB limit
