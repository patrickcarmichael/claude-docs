## Migrating to Claude 4.5

Source: https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/about-claude/models/migrating-to-claude-4


This guide covers two key migration paths to Claude 4.5 models:

* **Claude Sonnet 3.7 → Claude Sonnet 4.5**: Our most intelligent model with best-in-class reasoning, coding, and long-running agent capabilities
* **Claude Haiku 3.5 → Claude Haiku 4.5**: Our fastest and most intelligent Haiku model with near-frontier performance for real-time applications and high-volume intelligent processing

Both migrations involve breaking changes that require updates to your implementation. This guide will walk you through each migration path with step-by-step instructions and clearly marked breaking changes.

Before starting your migration, we recommend reviewing [What's new in Claude 4.5](/en/docs/about-claude/models/whats-new-claude-4-5) to understand the new features and capabilities available in these models, including extended thinking, context awareness, and behavioral improvements.
