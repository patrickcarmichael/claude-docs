## Create a Message Batch

Source: https://docs.claude.com/en/api/creating-message-batches

post /v1/messages/batches
Send a batch of Message creation requests.

The Message Batches API can be used to process multiple Messages API requests at once. Once a Message Batch is created, it begins processing immediately. Batches can take up to 24 hours to complete.

Learn more about the Message Batches API in our [user guide](/en/docs/build-with-claude/batch-processing)
