## How it works

When enabled, Claude automatically checks its memory directory before starting tasks. Claude can create, read, update, and delete files in the `/memories` directory to store what it learns while working, then reference those memories in future conversations to handle similar tasks more effectively or pick up where it left off.

Since this is a client-side tool, Claude makes tool calls to perform memory operations, and your application executes those operations locally. This gives you complete control over where and how the memory is stored. For security, you should restrict all memory operations to the `/memories` directory.

### Example: How memory tool calls work

When you ask Claude to help with a task, Claude automatically checks its memory directory first. Here's what a typical interaction looks like:

**1. User request:**
```
"Help me respond to this customer service ticket."
```
**2. Claude checks the memory directory:**
```
"I'll help you respond to the customer service ticket. Let me check my memory for any previous context."
```
Claude calls the memory tool:
```json
{
  "type": "tool_use",
  "id": "toolu_01C4D5E6F7G8H9I0J1K2L3M4",
  "name": "memory",
  "input": {
    "command": "view",
    "path": "/memories"
  }
}
```
**3. Your application returns the directory contents:**
```json
{
  "type": "tool_result",
  "tool_use_id": "toolu_01C4D5E6F7G8H9I0J1K2L3M4",
  "content": "Directory: /memories\n- customer_service_guidelines.xml\n- refund_policies.xml"
}
```
**4. Claude reads relevant files:**
```json
{
  "type": "tool_use",
  "id": "toolu_01D5E6F7G8H9I0J1K2L3M4N5",
  "name": "memory",
  "input": {
    "command": "view",
    "path": "/memories/customer_service_guidelines.xml"
  }
}
```
**5. Your application returns the file contents:**
```json
{
  "type": "tool_result",
  "tool_use_id": "toolu_01D5E6F7G8H9I0J1K2L3M4N5",
  "content": "<guidelines>\n<addressing_customers>\n- Always address customers by their first name\n- Use empathetic language\n..."
}
```
**6. Claude uses the memory to help:**
```
"Based on your customer service guidelines, I can help you craft a response. Please share the ticket details..."
```
