## Example prompt template

Let's consider a simple application that translates English text to Spanish. The translated text would be variable since you would expect this text to change between users or calls to Claude. This translated text could be dynamically retrieved from databases or the user's input.

Thus, for your translation app, you might use this simple prompt template:
```
Translate this text from English to Spanish: {{text}}
```
