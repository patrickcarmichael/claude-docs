## Service tiers

Source: https://docs.claude.com/en/api/service-tiers

Different tiers of service allow you to balance availability, performance, and predictable costs based on your application's needs.

We offer three service tiers:

* **Priority Tier:** Best for workflows deployed in production where time, availability, and predictable pricing are important
* **Standard:** Default tier for both piloting and scaling everyday use cases
* **Batch:** Best for asynchronous workflows which can wait or benefit from being outside your normal capacity
