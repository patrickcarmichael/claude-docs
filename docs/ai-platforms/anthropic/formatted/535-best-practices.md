## Best practices

When working with multilingual content:

1. **Provide clear language context**: While Claude can detect the target language automatically, explicitly stating the desired input/output language improves reliability. For enhanced fluency, you can prompt Claude to use "idiomatic speech as if it were a native speaker."
2. **Use native scripts**: Submit text in its native script rather than transliteration for optimal results
3. **Consider cultural context**: Effective communication often requires cultural and regional awareness beyond pure translation

We also suggest following our general [prompt engineering guidelines](/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/overview) to better improve Claude's performance.
