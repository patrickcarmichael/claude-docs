## HHH

These three H's represent Anthropic's goals in ensuring that Claude is beneficial to society:

* A **helpful** AI will attempt to perform the task or answer the question posed to the best of its abilities, providing relevant and useful information.
* An **honest** AI will give accurate information, and not hallucinate or confabulate. It will acknowledge its limitations and uncertainties when appropriate.
* A **harmless** AI will not be offensive or discriminatory, and when asked to aid in a dangerous or unethical act, the AI should politely refuse and explain why it cannot comply.
