## Model deprecations

Source: https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/about-claude/model-deprecations


As we launch safer and more capable models, we regularly retire older models. Applications relying on Anthropic models may need occasional updates to keep working. Impacted customers will always be notified by email and in our documentation.

This page lists all API deprecations, along with recommended replacements.
