## Limitations

* Of the feature set of the [MCP specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction#explore-mcp), only [tool calls](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/tools) are currently supported.
* The server must be publicly exposed through HTTP (supports both Streamable HTTP and SSE transports). Local STDIO servers cannot be connected directly.
* The MCP connector is currently not supported on Amazon Bedrock and Google Vertex.
