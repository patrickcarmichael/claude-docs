## Limitations

While Claude's image understanding capabilities are cutting-edge, there are some limitations to be aware of:

* **People identification**: Claude [cannot be used](https://www.anthropic.com/legal/aup) to identify (i.e., name) people in images and will refuse to do so.
* **Accuracy**: Claude may hallucinate or make mistakes when interpreting low-quality, rotated, or very small images under 200 pixels.
* **Spatial reasoning**: Claude's spatial reasoning abilities are limited. It may struggle with tasks requiring precise localization or layouts, like reading an analog clock face or describing exact positions of chess pieces.
* **Counting**: Claude can give approximate counts of objects in an image but may not always be precisely accurate, especially with large numbers of small objects.
* **AI generated images**: Claude does not know if an image is AI-generated and may be incorrect if asked. Do not rely on it to detect fake or synthetic images.
* **Inappropriate content**: Claude will not process inappropriate or explicit images that violate our [Acceptable Use Policy](https://www.anthropic.com/legal/aup).
* **Healthcare applications**: While Claude can analyze general medical images, it is not designed to interpret complex diagnostic scans such as CTs or MRIs. Claude's outputs should not be considered a substitute for professional medical advice or diagnosis.

Always carefully review and verify Claude's image interpretations, especially for high-stakes use cases. Do not use Claude for tasks requiring perfect precision or sensitive image analysis without human oversight.
