## What are plugins?

Plugins are packages of Claude Code extensions that can include:

* **Commands**: Custom slash commands
* **Agents**: Specialized subagents for specific tasks
* **Skills**: Model-invoked capabilities that Claude uses autonomously
* **Hooks**: Event handlers that respond to tool use and other events
* **MCP servers**: External tool integrations via Model Context Protocol

For complete information on plugin structure and how to create plugins, see [Plugins](https://code.claude.com/docs/plugins).
