## Building with the Claude Agent SDK

If you're building coding agents powered by the Claude Agent SDK, please note that **Claude Code** refers specifically to Anthropic's official product including the CLI, VS Code extension, web experience, and future integrations we build.

### For partners integrating Claude Agent SDK:

>   **📝 Note**
>
> The use of Claude branding for products built on Claude is optional.

When referencing Claude in your agent selector or product:

**Allowed naming options:**

* **Claude Agent** (preferred for dropdown menus)
* **Claude** (when within a menu already labeled "Agents")
* **{YourAgentName} Powered by Claude** (if you have an existing agent name)

**Not permitted:**

* "Claude Code" or "Claude Code Agent"
* Claude Code-branded ASCII art or visual elements that mimic Claude Code

Your product should maintain its own branding and not appear to be Claude Code or any Anthropic product.

For questions about branding compliance or to discuss your product's Claude integration, [contact our sales team](https://claude.com/contact-sales).
