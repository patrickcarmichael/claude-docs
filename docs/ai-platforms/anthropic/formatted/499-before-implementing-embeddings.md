## Before implementing embeddings

When selecting an embeddings provider, there are several factors you can consider depending on your needs and preferences:

* Dataset size & domain specificity: size of the model training dataset and its relevance to the domain you want to embed. Larger or more domain-specific data generally produces better in-domain embeddings
* Inference performance: embedding lookup speed and end-to-end latency. This is a particularly important consideration for large scale production deployments
* Customization: options for continued training on private data, or specialization of models for very specific domains. This can improve performance on unique vocabularies
