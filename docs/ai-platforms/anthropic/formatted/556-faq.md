## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Do I need multiple cache breakpoints or is one at the end sufficient?">
    **In most cases, a single cache breakpoint at the end of your static content is sufficient.** The system automatically checks for cache hits at all previous content block boundaries (up to 20 blocks before your breakpoint) and uses the longest matching prefix.

    You only need multiple breakpoints if:

    * You have more than 20 content blocks before your desired cache point
    * You want to cache sections that update at different frequencies independently
    * You need explicit control over what gets cached for cost optimization

    Example: If you have system instructions (rarely change) and RAG context (changes daily), you might use two breakpoints to cache them separately.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do cache breakpoints add extra cost?">
    No, cache breakpoints themselves are free. You only pay for:

    * Writing content to cache (25% more than base input tokens for 5-minute TTL)
    * Reading from cache (10% of base input token price)
    * Regular input tokens for uncached content

    The number of breakpoints doesn't affect pricing - only the amount of content cached and read matters.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I calculate total input tokens from the usage fields?">
    The usage response includes three separate input token fields that together represent your total input:
```
    total_input_tokens = cache_read_input_tokens + cache_creation_input_tokens + input_tokens
```
    * `cache_read_input_tokens`: Tokens retrieved from cache (everything before cache breakpoints that was cached)
    * `cache_creation_input_tokens`: New tokens being written to cache (at cache breakpoints)
    * `input_tokens`: Tokens **after the last cache breakpoint** that aren't cached

    **Important:** `input_tokens` does NOT represent all input tokens - only the portion after your last cache breakpoint. If you have cached content, `input_tokens` will typically be much smaller than your total input.

    **Example:** With a 200K token document cached and a 50 token user question:

    * `cache_read_input_tokens`: 200,000
    * `cache_creation_input_tokens`: 0
    * `input_tokens`: 50
    * **Total**: 200,050 tokens

    This breakdown is critical for understanding both your costs and rate limit usage. See [Tracking cache performance](#tracking-cache-performance) for more details.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is the cache lifetime?">
    The cache's default minimum lifetime (TTL) is 5 minutes. This lifetime is refreshed each time the cached content is used.

    If you find that 5 minutes is too short, Anthropic also offers a [1-hour cache TTL](#1-hour-cache-duration).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How many cache breakpoints can I use?">
    You can define up to 4 cache breakpoints (using `cache_control` parameters) in your prompt.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is prompt caching available for all models?">
    No, prompt caching is currently only available for Claude Opus 4.1, Claude Opus 4, Claude Sonnet 4.5, Claude Sonnet 4, Claude Sonnet 3.7, Claude Haiku 4.5, Claude Haiku 3.5, Claude Haiku 3, and Claude Opus 3 ([deprecated](/en/docs/about-claude/model-deprecations)).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How does prompt caching work with extended thinking?">
    Cached system prompts and tools will be reused when thinking parameters change. However, thinking changes (enabling/disabling or budget changes) will invalidate previously cached prompt prefixes with messages content.

    For more details on cache invalidation, see [What invalidates the cache](#what-invalidates-the-cache).

    For more on extended thinking, including its interaction with tool use and prompt caching, see the [extended thinking documentation](/en/docs/build-with-claude/extended-thinking#extended-thinking-and-prompt-caching).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I enable prompt caching?">
    To enable prompt caching, include at least one `cache_control` breakpoint in your API request.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use prompt caching with other API features?">
    Yes, prompt caching can be used alongside other API features like tool use and vision capabilities. However, changing whether there are images in a prompt or modifying tool use settings will break the cache.

    For more details on cache invalidation, see [What invalidates the cache](#what-invalidates-the-cache).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How does prompt caching affect pricing?">
    Prompt caching introduces a new pricing structure where cache writes cost 25% more than base input tokens, while cache hits cost only 10% of the base input token price.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I manually clear the cache?">
    Currently, there's no way to manually clear the cache. Cached prefixes automatically expire after a minimum of 5 minutes of inactivity.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How can I track the effectiveness of my caching strategy?">
    You can monitor cache performance using the `cache_creation_input_tokens` and `cache_read_input_tokens` fields in the API response.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What can break the cache?">
    See [What invalidates the cache](#what-invalidates-the-cache) for more details on cache invalidation, including a list of changes that require creating a new cache entry.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How does prompt caching handle privacy and data separation?">
    Prompt caching is designed with strong privacy and data separation measures:

    1. Cache keys are generated using a cryptographic hash of the prompts up to the cache control point. This means only requests with identical prompts can access a specific cache.

    2. Caches are organization-specific. Users within the same organization can access the same cache if they use identical prompts, but caches are not shared across different organizations, even for identical prompts.

    3. The caching mechanism is designed to maintain the integrity and privacy of each unique conversation or context.

    4. It's safe to use `cache_control` anywhere in your prompts. For cost efficiency, it's better to exclude highly variable parts (e.g., user's arbitrary input) from caching.

    These measures ensure that prompt caching maintains data privacy and security while offering performance benefits.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use prompt caching with the Batches API?">
    Yes, it is possible to use prompt caching with your [Batches API](/en/docs/build-with-claude/batch-processing) requests. However, because asynchronous batch requests can be processed concurrently and in any order, cache hits are provided on a best-effort basis.

    The [1-hour cache](#1-hour-cache-duration) can help improve your cache hits. The most cost effective way of using it is the following:

    * Gather a set of message requests that have a shared prefix.
    * Send a batch request with just a single request that has this shared prefix and a 1-hour cache block. This will get written to the 1-hour cache.
    * As soon as this is complete, submit the rest of the requests. You will have to monitor the job to know when it completes.

    This is typically better than using the 5-minute cache simply because it’s common for batch requests to take between 5 minutes and 1 hour to complete. We’re considering ways to improve these cache hit rates and making this process more straightforward.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why am I seeing the error `AttributeError: 'Beta' object has no attribute 'prompt_caching'` in Python?">
    This error typically appears when you have upgraded your SDK or you are using outdated code examples. Prompt caching is now generally available, so you no longer need the beta prefix. Instead of:
```Python
      python client.beta.prompt_caching.messages.create(...)
```

    Simply use:
```Python
      python client.messages.create(...)
```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why am I seeing 'TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'messages')'?">
    This error typically appears when you have upgraded your SDK or you are using outdated code examples. Prompt caching is now generally available, so you no longer need the beta prefix. Instead of:
```typescript
    client.beta.promptCaching.messages.create(...)
```
    Simply use:
```typescript
    client.messages.create(...)
```javascript
  </Accordion>
