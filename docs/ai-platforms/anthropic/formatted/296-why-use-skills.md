## Why use Skills

Skills are reusable, filesystem-based resources that provide Claude with domain-specific expertise: workflows, context, and best practices that transform general-purpose agents into specialists. Unlike prompts (conversation-level instructions for one-off tasks), Skills load on-demand and eliminate the need to repeatedly provide the same guidance across multiple conversations.

**Key benefits**:

* **Specialize Claude**: Tailor capabilities for domain-specific tasks
* **Reduce repetition**: Create once, use automatically
* **Compose capabilities**: Combine Skills to build complex workflows
