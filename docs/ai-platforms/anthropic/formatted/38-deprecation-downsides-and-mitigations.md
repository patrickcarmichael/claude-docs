## Deprecation downsides and mitigations

We currently deprecate and retire models to ensure capacity for new model releases. We recognize that this comes with downsides:

* Users who value specific models must migrate to new versions
* Researchers lose access to models for ongoing and comparative studies
* Model retirement introduces safety- and model welfare-related risks

At some point, we hope to make past models publicly available again. In the meantime, we've committed to long-term preservation of model weights and other measures to help mitigate these impacts. For more details, see [Commitments on Model Deprecation and Preservation](https://www.anthropic.com/research/deprecation-commitments).
