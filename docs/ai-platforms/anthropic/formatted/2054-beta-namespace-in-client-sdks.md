## Beta namespace in client SDKs

Every SDK has a `beta` namespace that is available for accessing new features that Anthropic releases in beta versions. Use this in conjunction with [beta headers](/en/api/beta-headers) to access these features. Refer to each SDK's GitHub repository for specific usage examples.
