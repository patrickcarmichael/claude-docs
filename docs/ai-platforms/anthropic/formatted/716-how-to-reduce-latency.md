## How to reduce latency

### 1. Choose the right model

One of the most straightforward ways to reduce latency is to select the appropriate model for your use case. Anthropic offers a [range of models](/en/docs/about-claude/models/overview) with different capabilities and performance characteristics. Consider your specific requirements and choose the model that best fits your needs in terms of speed and output quality.

For speed-critical applications, **Claude Haiku 4.5** offers the fastest response times while maintaining high intelligence:
```python
import anthropic

client = anthropic.Anthropic()
