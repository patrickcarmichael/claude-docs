## Overview

Anthropic uses the following terms to describe the lifecycle of our models:

* **Active**: The model is fully supported and recommended for use.
* **Legacy**: The model will no longer receive updates and may be deprecated in the future.
* **Deprecated**: The model is no longer available for new customers but continues to be available for existing users until retirement. We assign a retirement date at this point.
* **Retired**: The model is no longer available for use. Requests to retired models will fail.

>   **⚠️ Warning**
>
> Please note that deprecated models are likely to be less reliable than active models. We urge you to move workloads to active models to maintain the highest level of support and reliability.
