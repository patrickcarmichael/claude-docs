## Methods of modification

### Method 1: CLAUDE.md files (project-level instructions)

CLAUDE.md files provide project-specific context and instructions that are automatically read by the Agent SDK when it runs in a directory. They serve as persistent "memory" for your project.

#### How CLAUDE.md works with the SDK

**Location and discovery:**

* **Project-level:** `CLAUDE.md` or `.claude/CLAUDE.md` in your working directory
* **User-level:** `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` for global instructions across all projects

**IMPORTANT:** The SDK only reads CLAUDE.md files when you explicitly configure `settingSources` (TypeScript) or `setting_sources` (Python):

* Include `'project'` to load project-level CLAUDE.md
* Include `'user'` to load user-level CLAUDE.md (`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`)

The `claude_code` system prompt preset does NOT automatically load CLAUDE.md - you must also specify setting sources.

**Content format:**
CLAUDE.md files use plain markdown and can contain:

* Coding guidelines and standards
* Project-specific context
* Common commands or workflows
* API conventions
* Testing requirements

#### Example CLAUDE.md

```markdown
