## Client SDKs

Source: https://docs.claude.com/en/api/client-sdks

We provide client libraries in a number of popular languages that make it easier to work with the Claude API.

This page includes brief installation instructions and links to the open-source GitHub repositories for Anthropic's Client SDKs. For basic usage instructions, see the [API reference](/en/api/overview) For detailed usage instructions, refer to each SDK's GitHub repository.

If you are using Amazon Bedrock, see [this guide](/en/docs/build-with-claude/claude-on-amazon-bedrock); if you are using Google Cloud Vertex AI, see [this guide](/en/docs/build-with-claude/claude-on-vertex-ai).
