## Usage and pricing

Web fetch usage has **no additional charges** beyond standard token costs:
```json
"usage": {
  "input_tokens": 25039,
  "output_tokens": 931,
  "cache_read_input_tokens": 0,
  "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0,
  "server_tool_use": {
    "web_fetch_requests": 1
  }
}
```
The web fetch tool is available on the Claude API at **no additional cost**. You only pay standard token costs for the fetched content that becomes part of your conversation context.

To protect against inadvertently fetching large content that would consume excessive tokens, use the `max_content_tokens` parameter to set appropriate limits based on your use case and budget considerations.

Example token usage for typical content:

* Average web page (10KB): \~2,500 tokens
* Large documentation page (100KB): \~25,000 tokens
* Research paper PDF (500KB): \~125,000 tokens
