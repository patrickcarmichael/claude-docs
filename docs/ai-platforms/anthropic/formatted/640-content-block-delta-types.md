## Content block delta types

Each `content_block_delta` event contains a `delta` of a type that updates the `content` block at a given `index`.

### Text delta

A `text` content block delta looks like:
```JSON Text delta theme={null}
event: content_block_delta
data: {"type": "content_block_delta","index": 0,"delta": {"type": "text_delta", "text": "ello frien"}}
```

### Input JSON delta

The deltas for `tool_use` content blocks correspond to updates for the `input` field of the block. To support maximum granularity, the deltas are *partial JSON strings*, whereas the final `tool_use.input` is always an *object*.

You can accumulate the string deltas and parse the JSON once you receive a `content_block_stop` event, by using a library like [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/concepts/json/#partial-json-parsing) to do partial JSON parsing, or by using our [SDKs](/en/api/client-sdks), which provide helpers to access parsed incremental values.

A `tool_use` content block delta looks like:
```JSON Input JSON delta theme={null}
event: content_block_delta
data: {"type": "content_block_delta","index": 1,"delta": {"type": "input_json_delta","partial_json": "{\"location\": \"San Fra"}}}
```
Note: Our current models only support emitting one complete key and value property from `input` at a time. As such, when using tools, there may be delays between streaming events while the model is working. Once an `input` key and value are accumulated, we emit them as multiple `content_block_delta` events with chunked partial json so that the format can automatically support finer granularity in future models.

### Thinking delta

When using [extended thinking](/en/docs/build-with-claude/extended-thinking#streaming-thinking) with streaming enabled, you'll receive thinking content via `thinking_delta` events. These deltas correspond to the `thinking` field of the `thinking` content blocks.

For thinking content, a special `signature_delta` event is sent just before the `content_block_stop` event. This signature is used to verify the integrity of the thinking block.

A typical thinking delta looks like:
```JSON Thinking delta theme={null}
event: content_block_delta
data: {"type": "content_block_delta", "index": 0, "delta": {"type": "thinking_delta", "thinking": "Let me solve this step by step:\n\n1. First break down 27 * 453"}}
```
The signature delta looks like:
```JSON Signature delta theme={null}
event: content_block_delta
data: {"type": "content_block_delta", "index": 0, "delta": {"type": "signature_delta", "signature": "EqQBCgIYAhIM1gbcDa9GJwZA2b3hGgxBdjrkzLoky3dl1pkiMOYds..."}}
```
