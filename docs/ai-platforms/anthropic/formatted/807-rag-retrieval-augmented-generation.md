## RAG (Retrieval augmented generation)

Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is a technique that combines information retrieval with language model generation to improve the accuracy and relevance of the generated text, and to better ground the model's response in evidence. In RAG, a language model is augmented with an external knowledge base or a set of documents that is passed into the context window. The data is retrieved at run time when a query is sent to the model, although the model itself does not necessarily retrieve the data (but can with [tool use](/en/docs/agents-and-tools/tool-use/overview) and a retrieval function). When generating text, relevant information first must be retrieved from the knowledge base based on the input prompt, and then passed to the model along with the original query. The model uses this information to guide the output it generates. This allows the model to access and utilize information beyond its training data, reducing the reliance on memorization and improving the factual accuracy of the generated text. RAG can be particularly useful for tasks that require up-to-date information, domain-specific knowledge, or explicit citation of sources. However, the effectiveness of RAG depends on the quality and relevance of the external knowledge base and the knowledge that is retrieved at runtime.
