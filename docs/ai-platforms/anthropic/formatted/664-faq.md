  <Accordion title="Can Claude read image URLs?">
    Yes, Claude can now process images from URLs with our URL image source blocks in the API.
    Simply use the "url" source type instead of "base64" in your API requests.
    Example:
```json
    {
      "type": "image",
      "source": {
        "type": "url",
        "url": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/Camponotus_flavomarginatus_ant.jpg"
      }
    }
```python
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is there a limit to the image file size I can upload?">
    Yes, there are limits:

    * API: Maximum 5MB per image
    * claude.ai: Maximum 10MB per image

    Images larger than these limits will be rejected and return an error when using our API.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How many images can I include in one request?">
    The image limits are:

    * Messages API: Up to 100 images per request
    * claude.ai: Up to 20 images per turn

    Requests exceeding these limits will be rejected and return an error.

  <Accordion title="Can I delete images I've uploaded?">

  {" "}

  <Accordion title="Where can I find details on data privacy for image uploads?">
    Please refer to our privacy policy page for information on how we handle
    uploaded images and other data. We do not use uploaded images to train our
    models.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if Claude's image interpretation seems wrong?">
    If Claude's image interpretation seems incorrect:

    1. Ensure the image is clear, high-quality, and correctly oriented.
    2. Try prompt engineering techniques to improve results.
    3. If the issue persists, flag the output in claude.ai (thumbs up/down) or contact our support team.

    Your feedback helps us improve!

  <Accordion title="Can Claude generate or edit images?">
    No, Claude is an image understanding model only. It can interpret and analyze images, but it cannot generate, produce, edit, manipulate, or create images.
