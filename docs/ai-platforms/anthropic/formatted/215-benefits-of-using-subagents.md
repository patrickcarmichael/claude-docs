## Benefits of Using Subagents

### Context Management

Subagents maintain separate context from the main agent, preventing information overload and keeping interactions focused. This isolation ensures that specialized tasks don't pollute the main conversation context with irrelevant details.

**Example**: A `research-assistant` subagent can explore dozens of files and documentation pages without cluttering the main conversation with all the intermediate search results - only returning the relevant findings.

### Parallelization

Multiple subagents can run concurrently, dramatically speeding up complex workflows.

**Example**: During a code review, you can run `style-checker`, `security-scanner`, and `test-coverage` subagents simultaneously, reducing review time from minutes to seconds.

### Specialized Instructions and Knowledge

Each subagent can have tailored system prompts with specific expertise, best practices, and constraints.

**Example**: A `database-migration` subagent can have detailed knowledge about SQL best practices, rollback strategies, and data integrity checks that would be unnecessary noise in the main agent's instructions.

### Tool Restrictions

Subagents can be limited to specific tools, reducing the risk of unintended actions.

**Example**: A `doc-reviewer` subagent might only have access to Read and Grep tools, ensuring it can analyze but never accidentally modify your documentation files.
