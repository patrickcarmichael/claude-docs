## Reducing latency

Source: https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/test-and-evaluate/strengthen-guardrails/reduce-latency


Latency refers to the time it takes for the model to process a prompt and and generate an output. Latency can be influenced by various factors, such as the size of the model, the complexity of the prompt, and the underlying infrastructure supporting the model and point of interaction.

>   **📝 Note**
>
> It's always better to first engineer a prompt that works well without model or prompt constraints, and then try latency reduction strategies afterward. Trying to reduce latency prematurely might prevent you from discovering what top performance looks like.
