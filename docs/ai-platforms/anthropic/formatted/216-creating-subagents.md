## Creating Subagents

### Programmatic Definition (Recommended)

Define subagents directly in your code using the `agents` parameter:
```typescript
import { query } from '@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk';

const result = query({
  prompt: "Review the authentication module for security issues",
  options: {
    agents: {
      'code-reviewer': {
        description: 'Expert code review specialist. Use for quality, security, and maintainability reviews.',
        prompt: `You are a code review specialist with expertise in security, performance, and best practices.

When reviewing code:
- Identify security vulnerabilities
- Check for performance issues
- Verify adherence to coding standards
- Suggest specific improvements

Be thorough but concise in your feedback.`,
        tools: ['Read', 'Grep', 'Glob'],
        model: 'sonnet'
      },
      'test-runner': {
        description: 'Runs and analyzes test suites. Use for test execution and coverage analysis.',
        prompt: `You are a test execution specialist. Run tests and provide clear analysis of results.

Focus on:
- Running test commands
- Analyzing test output
- Identifying failing tests
- Suggesting fixes for failures`,
        tools: ['Bash', 'Read', 'Grep'],
      }
    }
  }
});

for await (const message of result) {
  console.log(message);
}
```

### AgentDefinition Configuration

| Field         | Type                                         | Required | Description                                                      |
| :------------ | :------------------------------------------- | :------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `description` | `string`                                     | Yes      | Natural language description of when to use this agent           |
| `prompt`      | `string`                                     | Yes      | The agent's system prompt defining its role and behavior         |
| `tools`       | `string[]`                                   | No       | Array of allowed tool names. If omitted, inherits all tools      |
| `model`       | `'sonnet' \| 'opus' \| 'haiku' \| 'inherit'` | No       | Model override for this agent. Defaults to main model if omitted |

### Filesystem-Based Definition (Alternative)

You can also define subagents as markdown files in specific directories:

* **Project-level**: `.claude/agents/*.md` - Available only in the current project
* **User-level**: `~/.claude/agents/*.md` - Available across all projects

Each subagent is a markdown file with YAML frontmatter:
```markdown
---
name: code-reviewer
description: Expert code review specialist. Use for quality, security, and maintainability reviews.
tools: Read, Grep, Glob, Bash
---

Your subagent's system prompt goes here. This defines the subagent's
role, capabilities, and approach to solving problems.
```

**Note:** Programmatically defined agents (via the `agents` parameter) take precedence over filesystem-based agents with the same name.
