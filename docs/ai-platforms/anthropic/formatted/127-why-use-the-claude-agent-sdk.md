## Why use the Claude Agent SDK?

Built on top of the agent harness that powers Claude Code, the Claude Agent SDK provides all the building blocks you need to build production-ready agents.

Taking advantage of the work we've done on Claude Code including:

* **Context Management**: Automatic compaction and context management to ensure your agent doesn't run out of context.
* **Rich tool ecosystem**: File operations, code execution, web search, and MCP extensibility
* **Advanced permissions**: Fine-grained control over agent capabilities
* **Production essentials**: Built-in error handling, session management, and monitoring
* **Optimized Claude integration**: Automatic prompt caching and performance optimizations
