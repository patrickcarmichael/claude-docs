## Choose the best model to start with

There are two general approaches you can use to start testing which Claude model best works for your needs.

### Option 1: Start with a fast, cost-effective model

For many applications, starting with a faster, more cost-effective model like Claude Haiku 4.5 can be the optimal approach:

1. Begin implementation with Claude Haiku 4.5
2. Test your use case thoroughly
3. Evaluate if performance meets your requirements
4. Upgrade only if necessary for specific capability gaps

This approach allows for quick iteration, lower development costs, and is often sufficient for many common applications. This approach is best for:

* Initial prototyping and development
* Applications with tight latency requirements
* Cost-sensitive implementations
* High-volume, straightforward tasks

### Option 2: Start with the most capable model

For complex tasks where intelligence and advanced capabilities are paramount, you may want to start with the most capable model and then consider optimizing to more efficient models down the line:

1. Implement with Claude Sonnet 4.5
2. Optimize your prompts for these models
3. Evaluate if performance meets your requirements
4. Consider increasing efficiency by downgrading intelligence over time with greater workflow optimization

This approach is best for:

* Complex reasoning tasks
* Scientific or mathematical applications
* Tasks requiring nuanced understanding
* Applications where accuracy outweighs cost considerations
* Advanced coding
