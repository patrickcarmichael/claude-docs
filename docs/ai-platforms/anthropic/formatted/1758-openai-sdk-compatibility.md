## OpenAI SDK compatibility

Source: https://docs.claude.com/en/api/openai-sdk

Anthropic provides a compatibility layer that enables you to use the OpenAI SDK to test the Claude API. With a few code changes, you can quickly evaluate Anthropic model capabilities.

>   **📝 Note**
>
> This compatibility layer is primarily intended to test and compare model capabilities, and is not considered a long-term or production-ready solution for most use cases. While we do intend to keep it fully functional and not make breaking changes, our priority is the reliability and effectiveness of the [Claude API](/en/api/overview).

  For more information on known compatibility limitations, see [Important OpenAI compatibility limitations](#important-openai-compatibility-limitations).

  If you encounter any issues with the OpenAI SDK compatibility feature, please let us know [here](https://forms.gle/oQV4McQNiuuNbz9n8).

<Tip>
  For the best experience and access to Claude API full feature set ([PDF processing](/en/docs/build-with-claude/pdf-support), [citations](/en/docs/build-with-claude/citations), [extended thinking](/en/docs/build-with-claude/extended-thinking), and [prompt caching](/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-caching)), we recommend using the native [Claude API](/en/api/overview).
