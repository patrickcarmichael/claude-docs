## Activity logging

Bedrock provides an [invocation logging service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-invocation-logging.html) that allows customers to log the prompts and completions associated with your usage.

Anthropic recommends that you log your activity on at least a 30-day rolling basis in order to understand your activity and investigate any potential misuse.

>   **📝 Note**
>
> Turning on this service does not give AWS or Anthropic any access to your content.
