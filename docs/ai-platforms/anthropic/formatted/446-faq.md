## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What permissions are needed to use the Admin API?">
    Only organization members with the admin role can use the Admin API. They must also have a special Admin API key (starting with `sk-ant-admin`).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I create new API keys through the Admin API?">
    No, new API keys can only be created through the Claude Console for security reasons. The Admin API can only manage existing API keys.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens to API keys when removing a user?">
    API keys persist in their current state as they are scoped to the Organization, not to individual users.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can organization admins be removed via the API?">
    No, organization members with the admin role cannot be removed via the API for security reasons.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How long do organization invites last?">
    Organization invites expire after 21 days. There is currently no way to modify this expiration period.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Are there limits on workspaces?">
    Yes, you can have a maximum of 100 workspaces per Organization. Archived workspaces do not count towards this limit.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's the Default Workspace?">
    Every Organization has a "Default Workspace" that cannot be edited or removed, and has no ID. This Workspace does not appear in workspace list endpoints.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do organization roles affect Workspace access?">
    Organization admins automatically get the `workspace_admin` role to all workspaces. Organization billing members automatically get the `workspace_billing` role. Organization users and developers must be manually added to each workspace.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Which roles can be assigned in workspaces?">
    Organization users and developers can be assigned `workspace_admin`, `workspace_developer`, or `workspace_user` roles. The `workspace_billing` role can't be manually assigned - it's inherited from having the organization `billing` role.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can organization admin or billing members' workspace roles be changed?">
    Only organization billing members can have their workspace role upgraded to an admin role. Otherwise, organization admins and billing members can't have their workspace roles changed or be removed from workspaces while they hold those organization roles. Their workspace access must be modified by changing their organization role first.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens to workspace access when organization roles change?">
    If an organization admin or billing member is demoted to user or developer, they lose access to all workspaces except ones where they were manually assigned roles. When users are promoted to admin or billing roles, they gain automatic access to all workspaces.
  </Accordion>
