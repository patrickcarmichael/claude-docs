## Cancel a Message Batch

Source: https://docs.claude.com/en/api/canceling-message-batches

post /v1/messages/batches/{message_batch_id}/cancel
Batches may be canceled any time before processing ends. Once cancellation is initiated, the batch enters a `canceling` state, at which time the system may complete any in-progress, non-interruptible requests before finalizing cancellation.

The number of canceled requests is specified in `request_counts`. To determine which requests were canceled, check the individual results within the batch. Note that cancellation may not result in any canceled requests if they were non-interruptible.

Learn more about the Message Batches API in our [user guide](/en/docs/build-with-claude/batch-processing)
