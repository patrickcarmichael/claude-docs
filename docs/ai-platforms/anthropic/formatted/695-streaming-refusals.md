## Streaming refusals

Source: https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/test-and-evaluate/strengthen-guardrails/handle-streaming-refusals


Starting with Claude 4 models, streaming responses from Claude's API return **`stop_reason`: `"refusal"`** when streaming classifiers intervene to handle potential policy violations. This new safety feature helps maintain content compliance during real-time streaming.
