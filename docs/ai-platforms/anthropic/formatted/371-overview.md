## Overview

Computer use is a beta feature that enables Claude to interact with desktop environments. This tool provides:

* **Screenshot capture**: See what's currently displayed on screen
* **Mouse control**: Click, drag, and move the cursor
* **Keyboard input**: Type text and use keyboard shortcuts
* **Desktop automation**: Interact with any application or interface

While computer use can be augmented with other tools like bash and text editor for more comprehensive automation workflows, computer use specifically refers to the computer use tool's capability to see and control desktop environments.
