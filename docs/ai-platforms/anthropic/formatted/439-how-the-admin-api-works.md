## How the Admin API works

When you use the Admin API:

1. You make requests using your Admin API key in the `x-api-key` header
2. The API allows you to manage:
   * Organization members and their roles
   * Organization member invites
   * Workspaces and their members
   * API keys

This is useful for:

* Automating user onboarding/offboarding
* Programmatically managing workspace access
* Monitoring and managing API key usage
