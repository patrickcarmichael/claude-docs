## MCP connector

The MCP connector is a feature that allows API users to connect to MCP servers directly from the Messages API without building an MCP client. This enables seamless integration with MCP-compatible tools and services through the Claude API. The MCP connector supports features like tool calling and is available in public beta. See our [MCP connector documentation](/en/docs/agents-and-tools/mcp-connector) to learn more.
