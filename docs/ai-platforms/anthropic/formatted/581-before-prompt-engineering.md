## Before prompt engineering

This guide assumes that you have:

1. A clear definition of the success criteria for your use case
2. Some ways to empirically test against those criteria
3. A first draft prompt you want to improve

If not, we highly suggest you spend time establishing that first. Check out [Define your success criteria](/en/docs/test-and-evaluate/define-success) and [Create strong empirical evaluations](/en/docs/test-and-evaluate/develop-tests) for tips and guidance.
