## Pricing and rate limits

Token counting is **free to use** but subject to requests per minute rate limits based on your [usage tier](/en/api/rate-limits#rate-limits). If you need higher limits, contact sales through the [Claude Console](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/limits).

| Usage tier | Requests per minute (RPM) |
| ---------- | ------------------------- |
| 1          | 100                       |
| 2          | 2,000                     |
| 3          | 4,000                     |
| 4          | 8,000                     |

>   **📝 Note**
>
> Token counting and message creation have separate and independent rate limits -- usage of one does not count against the limits of the other.
