## Message Batches API

The Message Batches API is a powerful, cost-effective way to asynchronously process large volumes of [Messages](/en/api/messages) requests. This approach is well-suited to tasks that do not require immediate responses, with most batches finishing in less than 1 hour while reducing costs by 50% and increasing throughput.

You can [explore the API reference directly](/en/api/creating-message-batches), in addition to this guide.
