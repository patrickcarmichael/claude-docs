## Understanding and comparing results

The Evaluation tool offers several features to help you refine your prompts:

1. **Side-by-side comparison**: Compare the outputs of two or more prompts to quickly see the impact of your changes.
2. **Quality grading**: Grade response quality on a 5-point scale to track improvements in response quality per prompt.
3. **Prompt versioning**: Create new versions of your prompt and re-run the test suite to quickly iterate and improve results.

By reviewing results across test cases and comparing different prompt versions, you can spot patterns and make informed adjustments to your prompt more efficiently.
