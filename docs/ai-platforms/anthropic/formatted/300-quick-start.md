## Quick start

Use pdfplumber to extract text from PDFs:
```python
import pdfplumber

with pdfplumber.open("document.pdf") as pdf:
    text = pdf.pages[0].extract_text()
```

For advanced form filling, see [FORMS.md](FORMS.md).
````
When you request something that matches a Skill's description, Claude reads SKILL.md from the filesystem via bash. Only then does this content enter the context window.

### Level 3: Resources and code (loaded as needed)

**Content types: Instructions, code, and resources**. Skills can bundle additional materials:
```
pdf-skill/
├── SKILL.md (main instructions)
├── FORMS.md (form-filling guide)
├── REFERENCE.md (detailed API reference)
└── scripts/
    └── fill_form.py (utility script)
```
**Instructions**: Additional markdown files (FORMS.md, REFERENCE.md) containing specialized guidance and workflows

**Code**: Executable scripts (fill\_form.py, validate.py) that Claude runs via bash; scripts provide deterministic operations without consuming context

**Resources**: Reference materials like database schemas, API documentation, templates, or examples

Claude accesses these files only when referenced. The filesystem model means each content type has different strengths: instructions for flexible guidance, code for reliability, resources for factual lookup.

| Level                     | When Loaded             | Token Cost             | Content                                                               |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Level 1: Metadata**     | Always (at startup)     | \~100 tokens per Skill | `name` and `description` from YAML frontmatter                        |
| **Level 2: Instructions** | When Skill is triggered | Under 5k tokens        | SKILL.md body with instructions and guidance                          |
| **Level 3+: Resources**   | As needed               | Effectively unlimited  | Bundled files executed via bash without loading contents into context |

Progressive disclosure ensures only relevant content occupies the context window at any given time.

### The Skills architecture

Skills run in a code execution environment where Claude has filesystem access, bash commands, and code execution capabilities. Think of it like this: Skills exist as directories on a virtual machine, and Claude interacts with them using the same bash commands you'd use to navigate files on your computer.

**How Claude accesses Skill content:**

When a Skill is triggered, Claude uses bash to read SKILL.md from the filesystem, bringing its instructions into the context window. If those instructions reference other files (like FORMS.md or a database schema), Claude reads those files too using additional bash commands. When instructions mention executable scripts, Claude runs them via bash and receives only the output (the script code itself never enters context).

**What this architecture enables:**

**On-demand file access**: Claude reads only the files needed for each specific task. A Skill can include dozens of reference files, but if your task only needs the sales schema, Claude loads just that one file. The rest remain on the filesystem consuming zero tokens.

**Efficient script execution**: When Claude runs `validate_form.py`, the script's code never loads into the context window. Only the script's output (like "Validation passed" or specific error messages) consumes tokens. This makes scripts far more efficient than having Claude generate equivalent code on the fly.

**No practical limit on bundled content**: Because files don't consume context until accessed, Skills can include comprehensive API documentation, large datasets, extensive examples, or any reference materials you need. There's no context penalty for bundled content that isn't used.

This filesystem-based model is what makes progressive disclosure work. Claude navigates your Skill like you'd reference specific sections of an onboarding guide, accessing exactly what each task requires.

### Example: Loading a PDF processing skill

Here's how Claude loads and uses a PDF processing skill:

1. **Startup**: System prompt includes: `PDF Processing - Extract text and tables from PDF files, fill forms, merge documents`
2. **User request**: "Extract the text from this PDF and summarize it"
3. **Claude invokes**: `bash: read pdf-skill/SKILL.md` → Instructions loaded into context
4. **Claude determines**: Form filling is not needed, so FORMS.md is not read
5. **Claude executes**: Uses instructions from SKILL.md to complete the task

The diagram shows:

1. Default state with system prompt and skill metadata pre-loaded
2. Claude triggers the skill by reading SKILL.md via bash
3. Claude optionally reads additional bundled files like FORMS.md as needed
4. Claude proceeds with the task

This dynamic loading ensures only relevant skill content occupies the context window.
