## What you get

The prompt improver generates templates with:

* Detailed chain-of-thought instructions that guide Claude's reasoning process and typically improve its performance
* Clear organization using XML tags to separate different components
* Standardized example formatting that demonstrates step-by-step reasoning from input to output
* Strategic prefills that guide Claude's initial responses

>   **📝 Note**
>
> While examples appear separately in the Workbench UI, they're included at the start of the first user message in the actual API call. View the raw format by clicking "**\</> Get Code**" or insert examples as raw text via the Examples box.
