# Quickstart

> Get started with OpenRouter's unified API for hundreds of AI models. Learn how to integrate using OpenAI SDK, direct API calls, or third-party frameworks.

OpenRouter provides a unified API that gives you access to hundreds of AI models through a single endpoint, while automatically handling fallbacks and selecting the most cost-effective options. Get started with just a few lines of code using your preferred SDK or framework.

<Tip>
  Looking for information about free models and rate limits? Please see the [FAQ](/docs/faq#how-are-rate-limits-calculated)
</Tip>

In the examples below, the OpenRouter-specific headers are optional. Setting them allows your app to appear on the OpenRouter leaderboards. For detailed information about app attribution, see our [App Attribution guide](/docs/app-attribution).

## Using the OpenRouter SDK (Beta)

<CodeGroup>
  ```typescript title="TypeScript SDK"
  import { OpenRouter } from '@openrouter/sdk';

  const openRouter = new OpenRouter({
    apiKey: '<OPENROUTER_API_KEY>',
    defaultHeaders: {
      'HTTP-Referer': '<YOUR_SITE_URL>', // Optional. Site URL for rankings on openrouter.ai.
      'X-Title': '<YOUR_SITE_NAME>', // Optional. Site title for rankings on openrouter.ai.
    },
  });

  const completion = await openRouter.chat.send({
    model: 'openai/gpt-4o',
    messages: [
      {
        role: 'user',
        content: 'What is the meaning of life?',
      },
    ],
    stream: false,
  });

  console.log(completion.choices[0].message.content);
  ```

# Frequently Asked Questions

> Find answers to commonly asked questions about OpenRouter's unified API, model access, pricing, and integration.

## Getting started

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why should I use OpenRouter?">
    OpenRouter provides a unified API to access all the major LLM models on the
    market. It also allows users to aggregate their billing in one place and
    keep track of all of their usage using our analytics.

    OpenRouter passes through the pricing of the underlying providers, while pooling their uptime,
    so you get the same pricing you'd get from the provider directly, with a
    unified API and fallbacks so that you get much better uptime.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I get started with OpenRouter?">
    To get started, create an account and add credits on the
    [Credits](https://openrouter.ai/settings/credits) page. Credits are simply
    deposits on OpenRouter that you use for LLM inference.
    When you use the API or chat interface, we deduct the request cost from your
    credits. Each model and provider has a different price per million tokens.

    Once you have credits you can either use the chat room, or create API keys
    and start using the API. You can read our [quickstart](/docs/quickstart)
    guide for code samples and more.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I get support?">
    The best way to get technical support is to join our
    [Discord](https://discord.gg/openrouter) and ask the community in the #help forum.

    For billing and account management questions, please contact us at [support@openrouter.ai](mailto:support@openrouter.ai).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I get billed for my usage on OpenRouter?">
    For each model we have the pricing displayed per million tokens. There is
    usually a different price for prompt and completion tokens. There are also
    models that charge per request, for images and for reasoning tokens. All of
    these details will be visible on the models page.

    When you make a request to OpenRouter, we receive the total number of tokens processed
    by the provider. We then calculate the corresponding cost and deduct it from your credits.
    You can review your complete usage history in the [Activity tab](https://openrouter.ai/activity).

    You can also add the `usage: {include: true}` parameter to your chat request
    to get the usage information in the response.

    We pass through the pricing of the underlying providers; there is no markup
    on inference pricing (however we do charge a [fee](/docs/faq#pricing-and-fees) when purchasing credits).
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Pricing and Fees

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What are the fees for using OpenRouter?">
    OpenRouter charges a {getTotalFeeString('stripe')} fee when you purchase credits. We pass through
    the pricing of the underlying model providers without any markup, so you pay
    the same rate as you would directly with the provider.

    Crypto payments are charged a fee of {getTotalFeeString('coinbase')}.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is there a fee for using my own provider keys (BYOK)?">
    Yes, if you choose to use your own provider API keys (Bring Your Own Key -
    BYOK), the first {toHumanNumber(BYOK_FEE_MONTHLY_REQUEST_THRESHOLD)} BYOK
    requests per-month are free, and for all subsequent usage there is a fee
    of {bn(openRouterBYOKFee.fraction).times(100).toString()}% of what the same
    model and provider would normally cost on OpenRouter. This fee is deducted
    from your OpenRouter credits. This allows you to manage your rate limits and
    costs directly with the provider while still leveraging OpenRouter's unified
    interface.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Models and Providers

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What LLM models does OpenRouter support?">
    OpenRouter provides access to a wide variety of LLM models, including frontier models from major AI labs.
    For a complete list of models you can visit the [models browser](https://openrouter.ai/models) or fetch the list through the [models api](https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/models).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How frequently are new models added?">
    We work on adding models as quickly as we can. We often have partnerships with
    the labs releasing models and can release models as soon as they are
    available. If there is a model missing that you'd like OpenRouter to support, feel free to message us on
    [Discord](https://discord.gg/openrouter).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What are model variants?">
    Variants are suffixes that can be added to the model slug to change its behavior.

    Static variants can only be used with specific models and these are listed in our [models api](https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/models).

    1. `:free` - The model is always provided for free and has low rate limits.
    2. `:beta` - The model is not moderated by OpenRouter.
    3. `:extended` - The model has longer than usual context length.
    4. `:exacto` - The model only uses OpenRouter-curated high-quality endpoints.
    5. `:thinking` - The model supports reasoning by default.

    Dynamic variants can be used on all models and they change the behavior of how the request is routed or used.

    1. `:online` - All requests will run a query to extract web results that are attached to the prompt.
    2. `:nitro` - Providers will be sorted by throughput rather than the default sort, optimizing for faster response times.
    3. `:floor` - Providers will be sorted by price rather than the default sort, prioritizing the most cost-effective options.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="I am an inference provider, how can I get listed on OpenRouter?">
    You can read our requirements at the [Providers
    page](/docs/use-cases/for-providers). If you would like to contact us, the best
    place to reach us is over email.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is the expected latency/response time for different models?">
    For each model on OpenRouter we show the latency (time to first token) and the token
    throughput for all providers. You can use this to estimate how long requests
    will take. If you would like to optimize for throughput you can use the
    `:nitro` variant to route to the fastest provider.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How does model fallback work if a provider is unavailable?">
    If a provider returns an error OpenRouter will automatically fall back to the
    next provider. This happens transparently to the user and allows production
    apps to be much more resilient. OpenRouter has a lot of options to configure
    the provider routing behavior. The full documentation can be found [here](/docs/features/provider-routing).
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## API Technical Specifications

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What authentication methods are supported?">
    OpenRouter uses three authentication methods:

    1. Cookie-based authentication for the web interface and chatroom
    2. API keys (passed as Bearer tokens) for accessing the completions API and other core endpoints
    3. [Provisioning API keys](/docs/features/provisioning-api-keys) for programmatically managing API keys through the key management endpoints
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How are rate limits calculated?">
    For free models, rate limits are determined by the credits that you have purchased.
    If you have purchased at least {FREE_MODEL_CREDITS_THRESHOLD} credits, your free model rate limit will be {FREE_MODEL_HAS_CREDITS_RPD} requests per day.
    Otherwise, you will be rate limited to {FREE_MODEL_NO_CREDITS_RPD} free model API requests per day.

    You can learn more about how rate limits work for paid accounts in our [rate limits documentation](/docs/api-reference/limits).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What API endpoints are available?">
    OpenRouter implements the OpenAI API specification for /completions and
    /chat/completions endpoints, allowing you to use any model with the same
    request/response format. Additional endpoints like /api/v1/models are also
    available. See our [API documentation](/docs/api-reference/overview) for
    detailed specifications.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What are the supported formats?">
    The API supports text and images.
    [Images](/docs/api-reference/overview#images--multimodal) can be passed as
    URLs or base64 encoded images. PDF and other file types are coming soon.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How does streaming work?">
    Streaming uses server-sent events (SSE) for real-time token delivery. Set
    `stream: true` in your request to enable streaming responses.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What SDK support is available?">
    OpenRouter is a drop-in replacement for OpenAI. Therefore, any SDKs that
    support OpenAI by default also support OpenRouter. Check out our
    [docs](/docs/community/open-ai-sdk) for more details.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Privacy and Data Logging

Please see our [Terms of Service](https://openrouter.ai/terms) and [Privacy Policy](https://openrouter.ai/privacy).

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What data is logged during API use?">
    We log basic request metadata (timestamps, model used, token counts). Prompt
    and completion are not logged by default. We do zero logging of your prompts/completions,
    even if an error occurs, unless you opt-in to logging them.

    We have an opt-in [setting](https://openrouter.ai/settings/privacy) that
    lets users opt-in to log their prompts and completions in exchange for a 1%
    discount on usage costs.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What data is logged during Chatroom use?">
    The same data privacy applies to the chatroom as the API. All conversations
    in the chatroom are stored locally on your device. Conversations will not sync across devices.
    It is possible to export and import conversations using the settings menu in the chatroom.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What third-party sharing occurs?">
    OpenRouter is a proxy that sends your requests to the model provider for it to be completed.
    We work with all providers to, when possible, ensure that prompts and completions are not logged or used for training.
    Providers that do log, or where we have been unable to confirm their policy, will not be routed to unless the model training
    toggle is switched on in the [privacy settings](https://openrouter.ai/settings/privacy) tab.

    If you specify [provider routing](/docs/features/provider-routing) in your request, but none of the providers
    match the level of privacy specified in your account settings, you will get an error and your request will not complete.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Credit and Billing Systems

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What purchase options exist?">
    OpenRouter uses a credit system where the base currency is US dollars. All
    of the pricing on our site and API is denoted in dollars. Users can top up
    their balance manually or set up auto top up so that the balance is
    replenished when it gets below the set threshold.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do credits expire?">
    Per our [terms](https://openrouter.ai/terms), we reserve the right to expire
    unused credits after one year of purchase.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="My credits haven't showed up in my account">
    If you paid using Stripe, sometimes there is an issue with the Stripe
    integration and credits can get delayed in showing up on your account. Please allow up to one hour.
    If your credits still have not appeared after an hour, check to confirm you have not been charged and
    that you do not have a stripe receipt email. If you do not have a receipt email or have not been charged,
    your card may have been declined. Please try again with a different card or payment method.

    If you have been charged and still do not have credits, please reach out to us via email
    at [support@openrouter.ai](mailto:support@openrouter.ai) with details of the purchase.

    If you paid using crypto, please reach out to us via email at [support@openrouter.ai](mailto:support@openrouter.ai)
    and we will look into it.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's the refund policy?">
    Refunds for unused Credits may be requested within twenty-four (24) hours from the time the transaction was processed. If no refund request is received within twenty-four (24) hours following the purchase, any unused Credits become non-refundable. To request a refund within the eligible period, you can use the refund button on the [Credits](https://openrouter.ai/settings/credits) page. The unused credit amount will be refunded to your payment method; the platform fees are non-refundable. Note that cryptocurrency payments are never refundable.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How to monitor credit usage?">
    The [Activity](https://openrouter.ai/activity) page allows users to view
    their historic usage and filter the usage by model, provider and api key.

    live information about the balance and remaining credits for the account.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What free tier options exist?">
    All new users receive a very small free allowance to be able to test out OpenRouter.
    There are many [free models](https://openrouter.ai/models?max_price=0) available
    on OpenRouter, it is important to note that these models have low rate limits ({FREE_MODEL_NO_CREDITS_RPD} requests per day total)
    and are usually not suitable for production use. If you have purchased at least {FREE_MODEL_CREDITS_THRESHOLD} credits,
    the free models will be limited to {FREE_MODEL_HAS_CREDITS_RPD} requests per day.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do volume discounts work?">
    OpenRouter does not currently offer volume discounts, but you can reach out to us
    over email if you think you have an exceptional use case.

# Principles

> Learn about OpenRouter's guiding principles and mission. Understand our commitment to price optimization, standardized APIs, and high availability in AI model deployment.

OpenRouter helps developers source and optimize AI usage. We believe the future is multi-model and multi-provider.

## Why OpenRouter?

**Price and Performance**. OpenRouter scouts for the best prices, the lowest latencies, and the highest throughput across dozens of providers, and lets you choose how to [prioritize](/docs/features/provider-routing) them.

**Standardized API**. No need to change code when switching between models or providers. You can even let your users [choose and pay for their own](/docs/use-cases/oauth-pkce).

**Real-World Insights**. Be the first to take advantage of new models. See real-world data of [how often models are used](https://openrouter.ai/rankings) for different purposes. Keep up to date in our [Discord channel](https://discord.com/channels/1091220969173028894/1094454198688546826).

**Consolidated Billing**. Simple and transparent billing, regardless of how many providers you use.

**Higher Availability**. Fallback providers, and automatic, smart routing means your requests still work even when providers go down.

**Higher Rate Limits**. OpenRouter works directly with providers to provide better rate limits and more throughput.


# Models

> Access all major language models (LLMs) through OpenRouter's unified API. Browse available models, compare capabilities, and integrate with your preferred provider.

Explore and browse 400+ models and providers [on our website](/models), or [with our API](/docs/api-reference/models/get-models). You can also subscribe to our [RSS feed](/api/v1/models?use_rss=true) to stay updated on new models.

## Models API Standard

Our [Models API](/docs/api-reference/models/get-models) makes the most important information about all LLMs freely available as soon as we confirm it.

### API Response Schema

The Models API returns a standardized JSON response format that provides comprehensive metadata for each available model. This schema is cached at the edge and designed for reliable integration for production applications.

#### Root Response Object

```json
{
  "data": [
    /* Array of Model objects */
  ]
}
```

#### Model Object Schema

Each model in the `data` array contains the following standardized fields:

| Field                  | Type                                          | Description                                                                            |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`                   | `string`                                      | Unique model identifier used in API requests (e.g., `"google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview"`) |
| `canonical_slug`       | `string`                                      | Permanent slug for the model that never changes                                        |
| `name`                 | `string`                                      | Human-readable display name for the model                                              |
| `created`              | `number`                                      | Unix timestamp of when the model was added to OpenRouter                               |
| `description`          | `string`                                      | Detailed description of the model's capabilities and characteristics                   |
| `context_length`       | `number`                                      | Maximum context window size in tokens                                                  |

#### Architecture Object

```typescript
{
  "input_modalities": string[], // Supported input types: ["file", "image", "text"]
  "output_modalities": string[], // Supported output types: ["text"]
  "tokenizer": string,          // Tokenization method used
  "instruct_type": string | null // Instruction format type (null if not applicable)
}
```

#### Pricing Object

All pricing values are in USD per token/request/unit. A value of `"0"` indicates the feature is free.

```typescript
{
  "prompt": string,           // Cost per input token
  "completion": string,       // Cost per output token
  "request": string,          // Fixed cost per API request
  "image": string,           // Cost per image input
  "web_search": string,      // Cost per web search operation
  "internal_reasoning": string, // Cost for internal reasoning tokens
  "input_cache_read": string,   // Cost per cached input token read
  "input_cache_write": string   // Cost per cached input token write
}
```

#### Top Provider Object

```typescript
{
  "context_length": number,        // Provider-specific context limit
  "max_completion_tokens": number, // Maximum tokens in response
  "is_moderated": boolean         // Whether content moderation is applied
}
```

#### Supported Parameters

The `supported_parameters` array indicates which OpenAI-compatible parameters work with each model:

* `tools` - Function calling capabilities
* `tool_choice` - Tool selection control
* `max_tokens` - Response length limiting
* `temperature` - Randomness control
* `top_p` - Nucleus sampling
* `reasoning` - Internal reasoning mode
* `include_reasoning` - Include reasoning in response
* `structured_outputs` - JSON schema enforcement
* `response_format` - Output format specification
* `stop` - Custom stop sequences
* `frequency_penalty` - Repetition reduction
* `presence_penalty` - Topic diversity
* `seed` - Deterministic outputs

<Note title="Different models tokenize text in different ways">
  Some models break up text into chunks of multiple characters (GPT, Claude,
  Llama, etc), while others tokenize by character (PaLM). This means that token
  counts (and therefore costs) will vary between models, even when inputs and
  outputs are the same. Costs are displayed and billed according to the
  tokenizer for the model in use. You can use the `usage` field in the response
  to get the token counts for the input and output.
</Note>

If there are models or providers you are interested in that OpenRouter doesn't have, please tell us about them in our [Discord channel](https://openrouter.ai/discord).

## For Providers

If you're interested in working with OpenRouter, you can learn more on our [providers page](/docs/use-cases/for-providers).


# Privacy, Logging, and Data Collection

> Learn how OpenRouter & its providers handle your data, including logging and data collection.

When using AI through OpenRouter, whether via the chat interface or the API, your prompts and responses go through multiple touchpoints. You have control over how your data is handled at each step.

This page is designed to give a practical overview of how your data is handled, stored, and used. More information is available in the [privacy policy](/privacy) and [terms of service](/terms).

## Within OpenRouter

OpenRouter does not store your prompts or responses, *unless* you have explicitly opted in to prompt logging in your account settings. It's as simple as that.

OpenRouter samples a small number of prompts for categorization to power our reporting and model ranking. If you are not opted in to prompt logging, any categorization of your prompts is stored completely anonymously and never associated with your account or user ID. The categorization is done by model with a zero-data-retention policy.

OpenRouter does store metadata (e.g. number of prompt and completion tokens, latency, etc) for each request. This is used to power our reporting and model ranking, and your [activity feed](/activity).

## Provider Policies

### Training on Prompts

Each provider on OpenRouter has its own data handling policies. We reflect those policies in structured data on each AI endpoint that we offer.

On your account settings page, you can set whether you would like to allow routing to providers that may train on your data (according to their own policies). There are separate settings for paid and free models.

Wherever possible, OpenRouter works with providers to ensure that prompts will not be trained on, but there are exceptions. If you opt out of training in your account settings, OpenRouter will not route to providers that train. This setting has no bearing on OpenRouter's own policies and what we do with your prompts.

<Tip title="Data Policy Filtering">
  You can [restrict individual requests](/docs/features/provider-routing#requiring-providers-to-comply-with-data-policies)
  to only use providers with a certain data policy.

  This is also available as an account-wide setting in [your privacy settings](https://openrouter.ai/settings/privacy).
</Tip>

### Data Retention & Logging

Providers also have their own data retention policies, often for compliance reasons. OpenRouter does not have routing rules that change based on data retention policies of providers, but the retention policies as reflected in each provider's terms are shown below. Any user of OpenRouter can ignore providers that don't meet their own data retention requirements.

The full terms of service for each provider are linked from the provider's page, and aggregated in the [documentation](/docs/features/provider-routing#terms-of-service).

<ProviderDataRetentionTable />

## Enterprise EU in-region routing

For enterprise customers, OpenRouter supports EU in-region routing. When enabled for your account, your prompts and completions are processed within the European Union and do not leave the EU. Use the base URL [http://eu.openrouter.ai](http://eu.openrouter.ai) for API requests to keep traffic and data within Europe. This feature is only enabled for enterprise customers by request.

If you’re interested, please contact our enterprise team at [https://openrouter.ai/enterprise/form](https://openrouter.ai/enterprise/form).


# Zero Data Retention

> Learn how OpenRouter gives you control over your data

Zero Data Retention (ZDR) means that a provider will not store your data for any period of time.

OpenRouter has a [setting](/settings/privacy) that, when enabled, only allows you to route to endpoints that have a Zero Data Retention policy.

Providers that do not retain your data are also unable to train on your data. However we do have some endpoints & providers who do not train on your data but *do* retain it (e.g. to scan for abuse or for legal reasons). OpenRouter gives you controls over both of these policies.

## How OpenRouter Manages Data Policies

OpenRouter works with providers to understand each of their data policies and structures the policy data in a way that gives you control over which providers you want to route to.

Note that a provider's general policy may differ from the specific policy for a given endpoint. OpenRouter keeps track of the specific policy for each endpoint, works with providers to keep these policies up to date, and in some cases creates special agreements with providers to ensure data retention or training policies that are more privacy-focused than their default policies.

<Note>
  If OpenRouter is not able to establish or ascertain a clear policy for a provider or endpoint, we take a conservative stance and assume that the endpoint both retains and trains on data and mark it as such.
</Note>

A full list of providers and their data policies can be found [here](/docs/features/privacy-and-logging#data-retention--logging). Note that this list shows the default policy for each provider; if there is a particular endpoint that has a policy that differs from the provider default, it may not be available if "ZDR Only" is enabled.

## Per-Request ZDR Enforcement

In addition to the global ZDR setting in your [privacy settings](/settings/privacy), you can enforce Zero Data Retention on a per-request basis using the `zdr` parameter in your API calls.

The request-level `zdr` parameter operates as an "OR" with your account-wide ZDR setting - if either is enabled, ZDR enforcement will be applied. This means the per-request parameter can only be used to ensure ZDR is enabled for a specific request, not to override or disable account-wide ZDR enforcement.

This is useful for customers who don't want to globally enforce ZDR but need to ensure specific requests only route to ZDR endpoints.

### Usage

Include the `zdr` parameter in your provider preferences:

```json
{
  "model": "gpt-4",
  "messages": [...],
  "provider": {
    "zdr": true
  }
}
```

When `zdr` is set to `true`, the request will only be routed to endpoints that have a Zero Data Retention policy. When `zdr` is `false` or not provided, ZDR enforcement will still apply if enabled in your account settings.

## Caching

Some endpoints/models provide implicit caching of prompts. This keeps repeated prompt data in an in-memory cache in the provider's datacenter, so that the repeated part of the prompt does not need to be re-processed. This can lead to considerable cost savings.

OpenRouter has taken the stance that in-memory caching of prompts is *not* considered "retaining" data, and we therefore allow endpoints/models with implicit caching to be hit when a ZDR routing policy is in effect.

## OpenRouter's Retention Policy

OpenRouter itself has a ZDR policy; your prompts are not retained unless you specifically opt in to prompt logging.

## Zero Retention Endpoints

The following endpoints have a ZDR policy. Note that this list is also available progammatically via [https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/endpoints/zdr](https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/endpoints/zdr). It is automatically updated when there are changes to a provider's data policy.:

# Model Routing

> Route requests dynamically between AI models. Learn how to use OpenRouter's Auto Router and model fallback features for optimal performance and reliability.

OpenRouter provides two options for model routing.

## Auto Router

The [Auto Router](https://openrouter.ai/openrouter/auto), a special model ID that you can use to choose between selected high-quality models based on your prompt, powered by [NotDiamond](https://www.notdiamond.ai/).

<CodeGroup>
  ```typescript title="TypeScript SDK"
  import { OpenRouter } from '@openrouter/sdk';

  const openRouter = new OpenRouter({
    apiKey: '<OPENROUTER_API_KEY>',
  });

  const completion = await openRouter.chat.send({
    model: 'openrouter/auto',
    messages: [
      {
        role: 'user',
        content: 'What is the meaning of life?',
      },
    ],
  });

  console.log(completion.choices[0].message.content);
  ```

  ```typescript title="TypeScript (fetch)"
  const response = await fetch('https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': 'Bearer <OPENROUTER_API_KEY>',
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      model: 'openrouter/auto',
      messages: [
        {
          role: 'user',
          content: 'What is the meaning of life?',
        },
      ],
    }),
  });

  const data = await response.json();
  console.log(data.choices[0].message.content);
  ```

  ```python title="Python"
  import requests
  import json

  response = requests.post(
    url="https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions",
    headers={
      "Authorization": "Bearer <OPENROUTER_API_KEY>",
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
    data=json.dumps({
      "model": "openrouter/auto",
      "messages": [
        {
          "role": "user",
          "content": "What is the meaning of life?"
        }
      ]
    })
  )

  data = response.json()
  print(data['choices'][0]['message']['content'])
  ```
</CodeGroup>

The resulting generation will have `model` set to the model that was used.

## The `models` parameter

The `models` parameter lets you automatically try other models if the primary model's providers are down, rate-limited, or refuse to reply due to content moderation.

<CodeGroup>
  ```typescript title="TypeScript SDK"
  import { OpenRouter } from '@openrouter/sdk';

  const openRouter = new OpenRouter({
    apiKey: '<OPENROUTER_API_KEY>',
  });

  const completion = await openRouter.chat.send({
    models: ['anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet', 'gryphe/mythomax-l2-13b'],
    messages: [
      {
        role: 'user',
        content: 'What is the meaning of life?',
      },
    ],
  });

  console.log(completion.choices[0].message.content);
  ```

  ```typescript title="TypeScript (fetch)"
  const response = await fetch('https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': 'Bearer <OPENROUTER_API_KEY>',
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      models: ['anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet', 'gryphe/mythomax-l2-13b'],
      messages: [
        {
          role: 'user',
          content: 'What is the meaning of life?',
        },
      ],
    }),
  });

  const data = await response.json();
  console.log(data.choices[0].message.content);
  ```

  ```python title="Python"
  import requests
  import json

  response = requests.post(
    url="https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions",
    headers={
      "Authorization": "Bearer <OPENROUTER_API_KEY>",
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
    data=json.dumps({
      "models": ["anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet", "gryphe/mythomax-l2-13b"],
      "messages": [
        {
          "role": "user",
          "content": "What is the meaning of life?"
        }
      ]
    })
  )

  data = response.json()
  print(data['choices'][0]['message']['content'])
  ```
</CodeGroup>

If the model you selected returns an error, OpenRouter will try to use the fallback model instead. If the fallback model is down or returns an error, OpenRouter will return that error.

By default, any error can trigger the use of a fallback model, including context length validation errors, moderation flags for filtered models, rate-limiting, and downtime.

Requests are priced using the model that was ultimately used, which will be returned in the `model` attribute of the response body.

## Using with OpenAI SDK

To use the `models` array with the OpenAI SDK, include it in the `extra_body` parameter. In the example below, gpt-4o will be tried first, and the `models` array will be tried in order as fallbacks.

<Template
  data={{
  API_KEY_REF,
}}
>
  <CodeGroup>
    ```python
    from openai import OpenAI

    openai_client = OpenAI(
      base_url="https://openrouter.ai/api/v1",
      api_key={{API_KEY_REF}},
    )

    completion = openai_client.chat.completions.create(
        model="openai/gpt-4o",
        extra_body={
            "models": ["anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet", "gryphe/mythomax-l2-13b"],
        },
        messages=[
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": "What is the meaning of life?"
            }
        ]
    )

    print(completion.choices[0].message.content)
    ```

    ```typescript
    import OpenAI from 'openai';

    const openrouterClient = new OpenAI({
      baseURL: 'https://openrouter.ai/api/v1',
      apiKey: '{{API_KEY_REF}}',
    });

    async function main() {
      // @ts-expect-error
      const completion = await openrouterClient.chat.completions.create({
        model: 'openai/gpt-4o',
        models: ['anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet', 'gryphe/mythomax-l2-13b'],
        messages: [
          {
            role: 'user',
            content: 'What is the meaning of life?',
          },
        ],
      });
      console.log(completion.choices[0].message);
    }

    main();
    ```
  </CodeGroup>

# Provider Routing

> Route AI model requests across multiple providers intelligently. Learn how to optimize for cost, performance, and reliability with OpenRouter's provider routing.

OpenRouter routes requests to the best available providers for your model. By default, [requests are load balanced](#price-based-load-balancing-default-strategy) across the top providers to maximize uptime.

You can customize how your requests are routed using the `provider` object in the request body for [Chat Completions](/docs/api-reference/chat-completion) and [Completions](/docs/api-reference/completion).

<Tip>
  For a complete list of valid provider names to use in the API, see the [full
  provider schema](#json-schema-for-provider-preferences).
</Tip>

The `provider` object can contain the following fields:

| Field                      | Type              | Default | Description                                                                                                                       |

<Note title="EU data residency (Enterprise)">
  OpenRouter supports EU in-region routing for enterprise customers. When enabled, prompts and completions are processed entirely within the EU. Learn more in our [Privacy docs here](/docs/features/privacy-and-logging#enterprise-eu-in-region-routing). To contact our enterprise team, [fill out this form](https://openrouter.ai/enterprise/form).
</Note>

## Price-Based Load Balancing (Default Strategy)

For each model in your request, OpenRouter's default behavior is to load balance requests across providers, prioritizing price.

If you are more sensitive to throughput than price, you can use the `sort` field to explicitly prioritize throughput.

<Tip>
  When you send a request with `tools` or `tool_choice`, OpenRouter will only
  route to providers that support tool use. Similarly, if you set a
  `max_tokens`, then OpenRouter will only route to providers that support a
  response of that length.
</Tip>

Here is OpenRouter's default load balancing strategy:

1. Prioritize providers that have not seen significant outages in the last 30 seconds.
2. For the stable providers, look at the lowest-cost candidates and select one weighted by inverse square of the price (example below).
3. Use the remaining providers as fallbacks.

<Note title="A Load Balancing Example">
  If Provider A costs \$1 per million tokens, Provider B costs \$2, and Provider C costs \$3, and Provider B recently saw a few outages.

  * Your request is routed to Provider A. Provider A is 9x more likely to be first routed to Provider A than Provider C because $(1 / 3^2 = 1/9)$ (inverse square of the price).
  * If Provider A fails, then Provider C will be tried next.
  * If Provider C also fails, Provider B will be tried last.
</Note>

If you have `sort` or `order` set in your provider preferences, load balancing will be disabled.

## Provider Sorting

As described above, OpenRouter load balances based on price, while taking uptime into account.

If you instead want to *explicitly* prioritize a particular provider attribute, you can include the `sort` field in the `provider` preferences. Load balancing will be disabled, and the router will try providers in order.

The three sort options are:

* `"price"`: prioritize lowest price
* `"throughput"`: prioritize highest throughput
* `"latency"`: prioritize lowest latency

<CodeGroup>
  ```typescript title="TypeScript SDK"
  import { OpenRouter } from '@openrouter/sdk';

  const openRouter = new OpenRouter({
    apiKey: '<OPENROUTER_API_KEY>',
  });

  const completion = await openRouter.chat.send({
    model: 'meta-llama/llama-3.1-70b-instruct',
    messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Hello' }],
    provider: {
      sort: 'throughput',
    },
    stream: false,
  });
  ```

  ```typescript title="TypeScript (fetch)"
  fetch('https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': 'Bearer <OPENROUTER_API_KEY>',
      'HTTP-Referer': '<YOUR_SITE_URL>',
      'X-Title': '<YOUR_SITE_NAME>',
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      model: 'meta-llama/llama-3.1-70b-instruct',
      messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Hello' }],
      provider: {
        sort: 'throughput',
      },
    }),
  });
  ```

  ```python title="Python"
  import requests

  headers = {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer <OPENROUTER_API_KEY>',
    'HTTP-Referer': '<YOUR_SITE_URL>',
    'X-Title': '<YOUR_SITE_NAME>',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  }

  response = requests.post('https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions', headers=headers, json={
    'model': 'meta-llama/llama-3.1-70b-instruct',
    'messages': [{ 'role': 'user', 'content': 'Hello' }],
    'provider': {
      'sort': 'throughput',
    },
  })
  ```
</CodeGroup>

To *always* prioritize low prices, and not apply any load balancing, set `sort` to `"price"`.

To *always* prioritize low latency, and not apply any load balancing, set `sort` to `"latency"`.

## Nitro Shortcut

You can append `:nitro` to any model slug as a shortcut to sort by throughput. This is exactly equivalent to setting `provider.sort` to `"throughput"`.

<CodeGroup>
  ```typescript title="TypeScript SDK"
  import { OpenRouter } from '@openrouter/sdk';

  const openRouter = new OpenRouter({
    apiKey: '<OPENROUTER_API_KEY>',
  });

  const completion = await openRouter.chat.send({
    model: 'meta-llama/llama-3.1-70b-instruct:nitro',
    messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Hello' }],
    stream: false,
  });
  ```

  ```typescript title="TypeScript (fetch)"
  fetch('https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': 'Bearer <OPENROUTER_API_KEY>',
      'HTTP-Referer': '<YOUR_SITE_URL>',
      'X-Title': '<YOUR_SITE_NAME>',
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      model: 'meta-llama/llama-3.1-70b-instruct:nitro',
      messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Hello' }],
    }),
  });
  ```

  ```python title="Python"
  import requests

  headers = {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer <OPENROUTER_API_KEY>',
    'HTTP-Referer': '<YOUR_SITE_URL>',
    'X-Title': '<YOUR_SITE_NAME>',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  }

  response = requests.post('https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions', headers=headers, json={
    'model': 'meta-llama/llama-3.1-70b-instruct:nitro',
    'messages': [{ 'role': 'user', 'content': 'Hello' }],
  })
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Floor Price Shortcut

You can append `:floor` to any model slug as a shortcut to sort by price. This is exactly equivalent to setting `provider.sort` to `"price"`.

<CodeGroup>
  ```typescript title="TypeScript SDK"
  import { OpenRouter } from '@openrouter/sdk';

  const openRouter = new OpenRouter({
    apiKey: '<OPENROUTER_API_KEY>',
  });

  const completion = await openRouter.chat.send({
    model: 'meta-llama/llama-3.1-70b-instruct:floor',
    messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Hello' }],
    stream: false,
  });
  ```

  ```typescript title="TypeScript (fetch)"
  fetch('https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': 'Bearer <OPENROUTER_API_KEY>',
      'HTTP-Referer': '<YOUR_SITE_URL>',
      'X-Title': '<YOUR_SITE_NAME>',
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      model: 'meta-llama/llama-3.1-70b-instruct:floor',
      messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Hello' }],
    }),
  });
  ```

  ```python title="Python"
  import requests

  headers = {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer <OPENROUTER_API_KEY>',
    'HTTP-Referer': '<YOUR_SITE_URL>',
    'X-Title': '<YOUR_SITE_NAME>',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  }

  response = requests.post('https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions', headers=headers, json={
    'model': 'meta-llama/llama-3.1-70b-instruct:floor',
    'messages': [{ 'role': 'user', 'content': 'Hello' }],
  })
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Ordering Specific Providers

You can set the providers that OpenRouter will prioritize for your request using the `order` field.

| Field   | Type      | Default | Description                                                              |
| ------- | --------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `order` | string\[] | -       | List of provider slugs to try in order (e.g. `["anthropic", "openai"]`). |

The router will prioritize providers in this list, and in this order, for the model you're using. If you don't set this field, the router will [load balance](#price-based-load-balancing-default-strategy) across the top providers to maximize uptime.

<Tip>
  You can use the copy button next to provider names on model pages to get the exact provider slug,
  including any variants like "/turbo". See [Targeting Specific Provider Endpoints](#targeting-specific-provider-endpoints) for details.
</Tip>

OpenRouter will try them one at a time and proceed to other providers if none are operational. If you don't want to allow any other providers, you should [disable fallbacks](#disabling-fallbacks) as well.

### Example: Specifying providers with fallbacks

This example skips over OpenAI (which doesn't host Mixtral), tries Together, and then falls back to the normal list of providers on OpenRouter:

<CodeGroup>
  ```typescript title="TypeScript SDK"
  import { OpenRouter } from '@openrouter/sdk';

  const openRouter = new OpenRouter({
    apiKey: '<OPENROUTER_API_KEY>',
  });

  const completion = await openRouter.chat.send({
    model: 'mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct',
    messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Hello' }],
    provider: {
      order: ['openai', 'together'],
    },
    stream: false,
  });
  ```

  ```typescript title="TypeScript (fetch)"
  fetch('https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': 'Bearer <OPENROUTER_API_KEY>',
      'HTTP-Referer': '<YOUR_SITE_URL>',
      'X-Title': '<YOUR_SITE_NAME>',
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      model: 'mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct',
      messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Hello' }],
      provider: {
        order: ['openai', 'together'],
      },
    }),
  });
  ```

  ```python title="Python"
  import requests

  headers = {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer <OPENROUTER_API_KEY>',
    'HTTP-Referer': '<YOUR_SITE_URL>',
    'X-Title': '<YOUR_SITE_NAME>',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  }

  response = requests.post('https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions', headers=headers, json={
    'model': 'mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct',
    'messages': [{ 'role': 'user', 'content': 'Hello' }],
    'provider': {
      'order': ['openai', 'together'],
    },
  })
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Example: Specifying providers with fallbacks disabled

Here's an example with `allow_fallbacks` set to `false` that skips over OpenAI (which doesn't host Mixtral), tries Together, and then fails if Together fails:

<CodeGroup>
  ```typescript title="TypeScript SDK"
  import { OpenRouter } from '@openrouter/sdk';

  const openRouter = new OpenRouter({
    apiKey: '<OPENROUTER_API_KEY>',
  });

  const completion = await openRouter.chat.send({
    model: 'mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct',
    messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Hello' }],
    provider: {
      order: ['openai', 'together'],
      allowFallbacks: false,
    },
    stream: false,
  });
  ```

  ```typescript title="TypeScript (fetch)"
  fetch('https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': 'Bearer <OPENROUTER_API_KEY>',
      'HTTP-Referer': '<YOUR_SITE_URL>',
      'X-Title': '<YOUR_SITE_NAME>',
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      model: 'mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct',
      messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Hello' }],
      provider: {
        order: ['openai', 'together'],
        allow_fallbacks: false,
      },
    }),
  });
  ```

  ```python title="Python"
  import requests

  headers = {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer <OPENROUTER_API_KEY>',
    'HTTP-Referer': '<YOUR_SITE_URL>',
    'X-Title': '<YOUR_SITE_NAME>',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  }

  response = requests.post('https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions', headers=headers, json={
    'model': 'mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct',
    'messages': [{ 'role': 'user', 'content': 'Hello' }],
    'provider': {
      'order': ['openai', 'together'],
      'allow_fallbacks': False,
    },
  })
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Targeting Specific Provider Endpoints

Each provider on OpenRouter may host multiple endpoints for the same model, such as a default endpoint and a specialized "turbo" endpoint. To target a specific endpoint, you can use the copy button next to the provider name on the model detail page to obtain the exact provider slug.

For example, DeepInfra offers DeepSeek R1 through multiple endpoints:

* Default endpoint with slug `deepinfra`
* Turbo endpoint with slug `deepinfra/turbo`

By copying the exact provider slug and using it in your request's `order` array, you can ensure your request is routed to the specific endpoint you want:

<CodeGroup>
  ```typescript title="TypeScript SDK"
  import { OpenRouter } from '@openrouter/sdk';

  const openRouter = new OpenRouter({
    apiKey: '<OPENROUTER_API_KEY>',
  });

  const completion = await openRouter.chat.send({
    model: 'deepseek/deepseek-r1',
    messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Hello' }],
    provider: {
      order: ['deepinfra/turbo'],
      allowFallbacks: false,
    },
    stream: false,
  });
  ```

  ```typescript title="TypeScript (fetch)"
  fetch('https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': 'Bearer <OPENROUTER_API_KEY>',
      'HTTP-Referer': '<YOUR_SITE_URL>',
      'X-Title': '<YOUR_SITE_NAME>',
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      model: 'deepseek/deepseek-r1',
      messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Hello' }],
      provider: {
        order: ['deepinfra/turbo'],
        allow_fallbacks: false,
      },
    }),
  });
  ```

  ```python title="Python"
  import requests

  headers = {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer <OPENROUTER_API_KEY>',
    'HTTP-Referer': '<YOUR_SITE_URL>',
    'X-Title': '<YOUR_SITE_NAME>',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  }

  response = requests.post('https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions', headers=headers, json={
    'model': 'deepseek/deepseek-r1',
    'messages': [{ 'role': 'user', 'content': 'Hello' }],
    'provider': {
      'order': ['deepinfra/turbo'],
      'allow_fallbacks': False,
    },
  })
  ```
</CodeGroup>

This approach is especially useful when you want to consistently use a specific variant of a model from a particular provider.

## Requiring Providers to Support All Parameters

You can restrict requests only to providers that support all parameters in your request using the `require_parameters` field.

| Field                | Type    | Default | Description                                                     |
| -------------------- | ------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `require_parameters` | boolean | `false` | Only use providers that support all parameters in your request. |

With the default routing strategy, providers that don't support all the [LLM parameters](/docs/api-reference/parameters) specified in your request can still receive the request, but will ignore unknown parameters. When you set `require_parameters` to `true`, the request won't even be routed to that provider.

### Example: Excluding providers that don't support JSON formatting

For example, to only use providers that support JSON formatting:

<CodeGroup>
  ```typescript title="TypeScript SDK"
  import { OpenRouter } from '@openrouter/sdk';

  const openRouter = new OpenRouter({
    apiKey: '<OPENROUTER_API_KEY>',
  });

  const completion = await openRouter.chat.send({
    messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Hello' }],
    provider: {
      requireParameters: true,
    },
    responseFormat: { type: 'json_object' },
    stream: false,
  });
  ```

  ```typescript title="TypeScript (fetch)"
  fetch('https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': 'Bearer <OPENROUTER_API_KEY>',
      'HTTP-Referer': '<YOUR_SITE_URL>',
      'X-Title': '<YOUR_SITE_NAME>',
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Hello' }],
      provider: {
        require_parameters: true,
      },
      response_format: { type: 'json_object' },
    }),
  });
  ```

  ```python title="Python"
  import requests

  headers = {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer <OPENROUTER_API_KEY>',
    'HTTP-Referer': '<YOUR_SITE_URL>',
    'X-Title': '<YOUR_SITE_NAME>',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  }

  response = requests.post('https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions', headers=headers, json={
    'messages': [{ 'role': 'user', 'content': 'Hello' }],
    'provider': {
      'require_parameters': True,
    },
    'response_format': { 'type': 'json_object' },
  })
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Requiring Providers to Comply with Data Policies

You can restrict requests only to providers that comply with your data policies using the `data_collection` field.

| Field             | Type              | Default | Description                                           |
| ----------------- | ----------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `data_collection` | "allow" \| "deny" | "allow" | Control whether to use providers that may store data. |

* `allow`: (default) allow providers which store user data non-transiently and may train on it
* `deny`: use only providers which do not collect user data

Some model providers may log prompts, so we display them with a **Data Policy** tag on model pages. This is not a definitive source of third party data policies, but represents our best knowledge.

<Tip title="Account-Wide Data Policy Filtering">
  This is also available as an account-wide setting in [your privacy
  settings](https://openrouter.ai/settings/privacy). You can disable third party
  model providers that store inputs for training.
</Tip>

### Example: Excluding providers that don't comply with data policies

To exclude providers that don't comply with your data policies, set `data_collection` to `deny`:

<CodeGroup>
  ```typescript title="TypeScript SDK"
  import { OpenRouter } from '@openrouter/sdk';

  const openRouter = new OpenRouter({
    apiKey: '<OPENROUTER_API_KEY>',
  });

  const completion = await openRouter.chat.send({
    messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Hello' }],
    provider: {
      dataCollection: 'deny', // or "allow"
    },
    stream: false,
  });
  ```

  ```typescript title="TypeScript (fetch)"
  fetch('https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': 'Bearer <OPENROUTER_API_KEY>',
      'HTTP-Referer': '<YOUR_SITE_URL>',
      'X-Title': '<YOUR_SITE_NAME>',
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Hello' }],
      provider: {
        data_collection: 'deny', // or "allow"
      },
    }),
  });
  ```

  ```python title="Python"
  import requests

  headers = {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer <OPENROUTER_API_KEY>',
    'HTTP-Referer': '<YOUR_SITE_URL>',
    'X-Title': '<YOUR_SITE_NAME>',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  }

  response = requests.post('https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions', headers=headers, json={
    'messages': [{ 'role': 'user', 'content': 'Hello' }],
    'provider': {
      'data_collection': 'deny', # or "allow"
    },
  })
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Zero Data Retention Enforcement

You can enforce Zero Data Retention (ZDR) on a per-request basis using the `zdr` parameter, ensuring your request only routes to endpoints that do not retain prompts.

| Field | Type    | Default | Description                                                   |
| ----- | ------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `zdr` | boolean | -       | Restrict routing to only ZDR (Zero Data Retention) endpoints. |

When `zdr` is set to `true`, the request will only be routed to endpoints that have a Zero Data Retention policy. When `zdr` is `false` or not provided, it has no effect on routing.

<Tip title="Account-Wide ZDR Setting">
  This is also available as an account-wide setting in [your privacy
  settings](https://openrouter.ai/settings/privacy). The per-request `zdr` parameter
  operates as an "OR" with your account-wide ZDR setting - if either is enabled, ZDR enforcement will be applied. The request-level parameter can only ensure ZDR is enabled, not override account-wide enforcement.
</Tip>

### Example: Enforcing ZDR for a specific request

To ensure a request only uses ZDR endpoints, set `zdr` to `true`:

<CodeGroup>
  ```typescript title="TypeScript SDK"
  import { OpenRouter } from '@openrouter/sdk';

  const openRouter = new OpenRouter({
    apiKey: '<OPENROUTER_API_KEY>',
  });

  const completion = await openRouter.chat.send({
    model: 'gpt-4',
    messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Hello' }],
    provider: {
      zdr: true,
    },
    stream: false,
  });
  ```

  ```typescript title="TypeScript (fetch)"
  fetch('https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': 'Bearer <OPENROUTER_API_KEY>',
      'HTTP-Referer': '<YOUR_SITE_URL>',
      'X-Title': '<YOUR_SITE_NAME>',
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      model: 'gpt-4',
      messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Hello' }],
      provider: {
        zdr: true,
      },
    }),
  });
  ```

  ```python title="Python"
  import requests

  headers = {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer <OPENROUTER_API_KEY>',
    'HTTP-Referer': '<YOUR_SITE_URL>',
    'X-Title': '<YOUR_SITE_NAME>',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  }

  response = requests.post('https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions', headers=headers, json={
    'model': 'gpt-4',
    'messages': [{ 'role': 'user', 'content': 'Hello' }],
    'provider': {
      'zdr': True,
    },
  })
  ```
</CodeGroup>

This is useful for customers who don't want to globally enforce ZDR but need to ensure specific requests only route to ZDR endpoints.

## Distillable Text Enforcement

You can enforce distillable text filtering on a per-request basis using the `enforce_distillable_text` parameter, ensuring your request only routes to models where the author has allowed text distillation.

| Field                      | Type    | Default | Description                                                   |
| -------------------------- | ------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `enforce_distillable_text` | boolean | -       | Restrict routing to only models that allow text distillation. |

When `enforce_distillable_text` is set to `true`, the request will only be routed to models where the author has explicitly enabled text distillation. When `enforce_distillable_text` is `false` or not provided, it has no effect on routing.

This parameter is useful for applications that need to ensure their requests only use models that allow text distillation for training purposes, such as when building datasets for model fine-tuning or distillation workflows.

### Example: Enforcing distillable text for a specific request

To ensure a request only uses models that allow text distillation, set `enforce_distillable_text` to `true`:

<CodeGroup>
  ```typescript title="TypeScript SDK"
  import { OpenRouter } from '@openrouter/sdk';

  const openRouter = new OpenRouter({
    apiKey: '<OPENROUTER_API_KEY>',
  });

  const completion = await openRouter.chat.send({
    model: 'meta-llama/llama-3.1-70b-instruct',
    messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Hello' }],
    provider: {
      enforceDistillableText: true,
    },
    stream: false,
  });
  ```

  ```typescript title="TypeScript (fetch)"
  fetch('https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': 'Bearer <OPENROUTER_API_KEY>',
      'HTTP-Referer': '<YOUR_SITE_URL>',
      'X-Title': '<YOUR_SITE_NAME>',
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      model: 'meta-llama/llama-3.1-70b-instruct',
      messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Hello' }],
      provider: {
        enforce_distillable_text: true,
      },
    }),
  });
  ```

  ```python title="Python"
  import requests

  headers = {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer <OPENROUTER_API_KEY>',
    'HTTP-Referer': '<YOUR_SITE_URL>',
    'X-Title': '<YOUR_SITE_NAME>',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  }

  response = requests.post('https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions', headers=headers, json={
    'model': 'meta-llama/llama-3.1-70b-instruct',
    'messages': [{ 'role': 'user', 'content': 'Hello' }],
    'provider': {
      'enforce_distillable_text': True,
    },
  })
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Disabling Fallbacks

To guarantee that your request is only served by the top (lowest-cost) provider, you can disable fallbacks.

This is combined with the `order` field from [Ordering Specific Providers](#ordering-specific-providers) to restrict the providers that OpenRouter will prioritize to just your chosen list.

<CodeGroup>
  ```typescript title="TypeScript SDK"
  import { OpenRouter } from '@openrouter/sdk';

  const openRouter = new OpenRouter({
    apiKey: '<OPENROUTER_API_KEY>',
  });

  const completion = await openRouter.chat.send({
    messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Hello' }],
    provider: {
      allowFallbacks: false,
    },
    stream: false,
  });
  ```

  ```typescript title="TypeScript (fetch)"
  fetch('https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': 'Bearer <OPENROUTER_API_KEY>',
      'HTTP-Referer': '<YOUR_SITE_URL>',
      'X-Title': '<YOUR_SITE_NAME>',
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Hello' }],
      provider: {
        allow_fallbacks: false,
      },
    }),
  });
  ```

  ```python title="Python"
  import requests

  headers = {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer <OPENROUTER_API_KEY>',
    'HTTP-Referer': '<YOUR_SITE_URL>',
    'X-Title': '<YOUR_SITE_NAME>',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  }

  response = requests.post('https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions', headers=headers, json={
    'messages': [{ 'role': 'user', 'content': 'Hello' }],
    'provider': {
      'allow_fallbacks': False,
    },
  })
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Allowing Only Specific Providers

You can allow only specific providers for a request by setting the `only` field in the `provider` object.

| Field  | Type      | Default | Description                                       |
| ------ | --------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `only` | string\[] | -       | List of provider slugs to allow for this request. |

<Warning>
  Only allowing some providers may significantly reduce fallback options and
  limit request recovery.
</Warning>

<Tip title="Account-Wide Allowed Providers">
  You can allow providers for all account requests by configuring your [preferences](/settings/preferences). This configuration applies to all API requests and chatroom messages.

  Note that when you allow providers for a specific request, the list of allowed providers is merged with your account-wide allowed providers.
</Tip>

### Example: Allowing Azure for a request calling GPT-4 Omni

Here's an example that will only use Azure for a request calling GPT-4 Omni:

<CodeGroup>
  ```typescript title="TypeScript SDK"
  import { OpenRouter } from '@openrouter/sdk';

  const openRouter = new OpenRouter({
    apiKey: '<OPENROUTER_API_KEY>',
  });

  const completion = await openRouter.chat.send({
    model: 'openai/gpt-4o',
    messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Hello' }],
    provider: {
      only: ['azure'],
    },
    stream: false,
  });
  ```

  ```typescript title="TypeScript (fetch)"
  fetch('https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': 'Bearer <OPENROUTER_API_KEY>',
      'HTTP-Referer': '<YOUR_SITE_URL>',
      'X-Title': '<YOUR_SITE_NAME>',
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      model: 'openai/gpt-4o',
      messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Hello' }],
      provider: {
        only: ['azure'],
      },
    }),
  });
  ```

  ```python title="Python"
  import requests

  headers = {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer <OPENROUTER_API_KEY>',
    'HTTP-Referer': '<YOUR_SITE_URL>',
    'X-Title': '<YOUR_SITE_NAME>',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  }

  response = requests.post('https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions', headers=headers, json={
    'model': 'openai/gpt-4o',
    'messages': [{ 'role': 'user', 'content': 'Hello' }],
    'provider': {
      'only': ['azure'],
    },
  })
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Ignoring Providers

You can ignore providers for a request by setting the `ignore` field in the `provider` object.

| Field    | Type      | Default | Description                                      |
| -------- | --------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `ignore` | string\[] | -       | List of provider slugs to skip for this request. |

<Warning>
  Ignoring multiple providers may significantly reduce fallback options and
  limit request recovery.
</Warning>

<Tip title="Account-Wide Ignored Providers">
  You can ignore providers for all account requests by configuring your [preferences](/settings/preferences). This configuration applies to all API requests and chatroom messages.

  Note that when you ignore providers for a specific request, the list of ignored providers is merged with your account-wide ignored providers.
</Tip>

### Example: Ignoring DeepInfra for a request calling Llama 3.3 70b

Here's an example that will ignore DeepInfra for a request calling Llama 3.3 70b:

<CodeGroup>
  ```typescript title="TypeScript SDK"
  import { OpenRouter } from '@openrouter/sdk';

  const openRouter = new OpenRouter({
    apiKey: '<OPENROUTER_API_KEY>',
  });

  const completion = await openRouter.chat.send({
    model: 'meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct',
    messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Hello' }],
    provider: {
      ignore: ['deepinfra'],
    },
    stream: false,
  });
  ```

  ```typescript title="TypeScript (fetch)"
  fetch('https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': 'Bearer <OPENROUTER_API_KEY>',
      'HTTP-Referer': '<YOUR_SITE_URL>',
      'X-Title': '<YOUR_SITE_NAME>',
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      model: 'meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct',
      messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Hello' }],
      provider: {
        ignore: ['deepinfra'],
      },
    }),
  });
  ```

  ```python title="Python"
  import requests

  headers = {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer <OPENROUTER_API_KEY>',
    'HTTP-Referer': '<YOUR_SITE_URL>',
    'X-Title': '<YOUR_SITE_NAME>',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  }

  response = requests.post('https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions', headers=headers, json={
    'model': 'meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct',
    'messages': [{ 'role': 'user', 'content': 'Hello' }],
    'provider': {
      'ignore': ['deepinfra'],
    },
  })
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Quantization

Quantization reduces model size and computational requirements while aiming to preserve performance. Most LLMs today use FP16 or BF16 for training and inference, cutting memory requirements in half compared to FP32. Some optimizations use FP8 or quantization to reduce size further (e.g., INT8, INT4).

| Field           | Type      | Default | Description                                                                                     |
| --------------- | --------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `quantizations` | string\[] | -       | List of quantization levels to filter by (e.g. `["int4", "int8"]`). [Learn more](#quantization) |

<Warning>
  Quantized models may exhibit degraded performance for certain prompts,
  depending on the method used.
</Warning>

Providers can support various quantization levels for open-weight models.

### Quantization Levels

By default, requests are load-balanced across all available providers, ordered by price. To filter providers by quantization level, specify the `quantizations` field in the `provider` parameter with the following values:

* `int4`: Integer (4 bit)
* `int8`: Integer (8 bit)
* `fp4`: Floating point (4 bit)
* `fp6`: Floating point (6 bit)
* `fp8`: Floating point (8 bit)
* `fp16`: Floating point (16 bit)
* `bf16`: Brain floating point (16 bit)
* `fp32`: Floating point (32 bit)
* `unknown`: Unknown

### Example: Requesting FP8 Quantization

Here's an example that will only use providers that support FP8 quantization:

<CodeGroup>
  ```typescript title="TypeScript SDK"
  import { OpenRouter } from '@openrouter/sdk';

  const openRouter = new OpenRouter({
    apiKey: '<OPENROUTER_API_KEY>',
  });

  const completion = await openRouter.chat.send({
    model: 'meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct',
    messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Hello' }],
    provider: {
      quantizations: ['fp8'],
    },
    stream: false,
  });
  ```

  ```typescript title="TypeScript (fetch)"
  fetch('https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': 'Bearer <OPENROUTER_API_KEY>',
      'HTTP-Referer': '<YOUR_SITE_URL>',
      'X-Title': '<YOUR_SITE_NAME>',
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      model: 'meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct',
      messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Hello' }],
      provider: {
        quantizations: ['fp8'],
      },
    }),
  });
  ```

  ```python title="Python"
  import requests

  headers = {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer <OPENROUTER_API_KEY>',
    'HTTP-Referer': '<YOUR_SITE_URL>',
    'X-Title': '<YOUR_SITE_NAME>',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  }

  response = requests.post('https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions', headers=headers, json={
    'model': 'meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct',
    'messages': [{ 'role': 'user', 'content': 'Hello' }],
    'provider': {
      'quantizations': ['fp8'],
    },
  })
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Max Price

To filter providers by price, specify the `max_price` field in the `provider` parameter with a JSON object specifying the highest provider pricing you will accept.

For example, the value `{"prompt": 1, "completion": 2}` will route to any provider with a price of `<= $1/m` prompt tokens, and `<= $2/m` completion tokens or less.

Some providers support per request pricing, in which case you can use the `request` attribute of max\_price. Lastly, `image` is also available, which specifies the max price per image you will accept.

Practically, this field is often combined with a provider `sort` to express, for example, "Use the provider with the highest throughput, as long as it doesn't cost more than `$x/m` tokens."

## Terms of Service

You can view the terms of service for each provider below. You may not violate the terms of service or policies of third-party providers that power the models on OpenRouter.

# Exacto Variant

> Learn how to target OpenRouter-selected providers by using the :exacto model variant.

Introducing a new set of endpoints, `:exacto`, focused on higher tool‑calling accuracy by routing to a sub‑group of providers with measurably better tool‑use success rates. It uses the same request payloads as any other variant, but filters endpoints so that only vetted providers for the chosen model are considered. To learn more, read our [blog post](https://openrouter.ai/announcements/provider-variance-introducing-exacto).

## Using the Exacto Variant

Add `:exacto` to the end of any supported model slug. The curated allowlist is enforced before provider sorting, fallback, or load balancing — no extra provider preference config is required.

<CodeGroup>
  ```typescript title="TypeScript SDK"
  import { OpenRouter } from '@openrouter/sdk';

  const openRouter = new OpenRouter({
    apiKey: process.env.OPENROUTER_API_KEY,
  });

  const completion = await openRouter.chat.send({
    model: "moonshotai/kimi-k2-0905:exacto",
    messages: [
      {
        role: "user",
        content: "Draft a concise changelog entry for the Exacto launch.",
      },
    ],
    stream: false,
  });

  console.log(completion.choices[0].message.content);
  ```

  ```typescript title="TypeScript (OpenAI SDK)"
  import OpenAI from "openai";

  const client = new OpenAI({
    baseURL: "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1",
    apiKey: process.env.OPENROUTER_API_KEY,
  });

  const completion = await client.chat.completions.create({
    model: "moonshotai/kimi-k2-0905:exacto",
    messages: [
      {
        role: "user",
        content: "Draft a concise changelog entry for the Exacto launch.",
      },
    ],
  });
  ```

  ```shell title="cURL"
  curl https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENROUTER_API_KEY" \
    -d '{
    "model": "moonshotai/kimi-k2-0905:exacto",
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Summarize the latest release notes for me."
      }
    ]
  }'
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
  You can still supply fallback models with the `models` array. Any model that
  carries the `:exacto` suffix will enforce the curated provider list when it is
  selected.
</Tip>

## What Is the Exacto Variant?

Exacto is a curated routing variant specifically focused on tool‑calling accuracy. Unlike standard routing, which considers all available providers for a model, Exacto restricts routing to providers that demonstrate higher tool‑use accuracy and normal tool‑use propensity on real workloads.

## Why Use Exacto?

### Why We Built It

Providers running the same model can differ in accuracy due to implementation details in production inference. OpenRouter sees billions of requests monthly, giving us a unique vantage point to observe these differences and minimize surprises for users. Exacto combines benchmark results with real‑world tool‑calling telemetry to select the best‑performing providers.

### Recommended Use Cases

Exacto is optimized for quality‑sensitive, agentic workflows where tool‑calling accuracy and reliability are critical.

## Supported Models

Exacto endpoints are available for:

* Kimi K2 (`moonshotai/kimi-k2-0905:exacto`)
* DeepSeek v3.1 Terminus (`deepseek/deepseek-v3.1-terminus:exacto`)
* GLM 4.6 (`z-ai/glm-4.6:exacto`)
* GPT‑OSS 120B (`openai/gpt-oss-120b:exacto`)
* Qwen3 Coder (`qwen/qwen3-coder:exacto`)

## How We Select Providers

We use three inputs:

* Tool‑calling accuracy from real traffic across billions of calls
* Real‑time provider preferences (pins/ignores) from users making tool calls
* Benchmarking (internal eval suites, Groq OpenBench running LiveMCPBench, official tau2bench, and similar)

You will be routed only to providers that:

1. Are top‑tier on tool‑calling accuracy
2. Fall within a normal range of tool‑calling propensity
3. Are not frequently ignored or blacklisted by users when tools are provided

In our evaluations and open‑source benchmarks (e.g., tau2‑Bench, LiveMCPBench), Exacto shows materially fewer tool‑calling failures and more reliable tool use.

We will continue working with providers not currently in the Exacto pool to help them improve and be included. Exacto targets tool‑calling specifically and is not a broad statement on overall provider quality.

# Latency and Performance

> Learn about OpenRouter's performance characteristics, latency optimizations, and best practices for achieving optimal response times.

OpenRouter is designed with performance as a top priority. OpenRouter is heavily optimized to add as little latency as possible to your requests.

## Base Latency

Under typical production conditions, OpenRouter adds approximately 15ms of latency to your requests. This minimal overhead is achieved through:

* Edge computing using Cloudflare Workers to stay as close as possible to your application
* Efficient caching of user and API key data at the edge
* Optimized routing logic that minimizes processing time

## Performance Considerations

### Cache Warming

When OpenRouter's edge caches are cold (typically during the first 1-2 minutes of operation in a new region), you may experience slightly higher latency as the caches warm up. This normalizes once the caches are populated.

### Credit Balance Checks

To maintain accurate billing and prevent overages, OpenRouter performs additional database checks when:

* A user's credit balance is low (single digit dollars)
* An API key is approaching its configured credit limit

OpenRouter expires caches more aggressively under these conditions to ensure proper billing, which increases latency until additional credits are added.

### Model Fallback

When using [model routing](/docs/features/model-routing) or [provider routing](/docs/features/provider-routing), if the primary model or provider fails, OpenRouter will automatically try the next option. A failed initial completion unsurprisingly adds latency to the specific request. OpenRouter tracks provider failures, and will attempt to intelligently route around unavailable providers so that this latency is not incurred on every request.

## Best Practices

To achieve optimal performance with OpenRouter:

1. **Maintain Healthy Credit Balance**
   * Set up auto-topup with a higher threshold and amount
   * This helps avoid forced credit checks and reduces the risk of hitting zero balance
   * Recommended minimum balance: \$10-20 to ensure smooth operation

2. **Use Provider Preferences**
   * If you have specific latency requirements (whether time to first token, or time to last), there are [provider routing](/docs/features/provider-routing) features to help you achieve your performance and cost goals.


# Presets

> Learn how to use OpenRouter's presets to manage model configurations, system prompts, and parameters across your applications.

[Presets](/settings/presets) allow you to separate your LLM configuration from your code. Create and manage presets through the OpenRouter web application to control provider routing, model selection, system prompts, and other parameters, then reference them in OpenRouter API requests.

## What are Presets?

Presets are named configurations that encapsulate all the settings needed for a specific use case. For example, you might create:

* An "email-copywriter" preset for generating marketing copy
* An "inbound-classifier" preset for categorizing customer inquiries
* A "code-reviewer" preset for analyzing pull requests

Each preset can manage:

* Provider routing preferences (sort by price, latency, etc.)
* Model selection (specific model or array of models with fallbacks)
* System prompts
* Generation parameters (temperature, top\_p, etc.)
* Provider inclusion/exclusion rules

## Quick Start

1. [Create a preset](/settings/presets). For example, select a model and restrict provider routing to just a few providers.
   ![Creating a new preset](file:9200af66-cd2b-4c02-b94a-127a22a3d830 "A new preset")

2. Make an API request to the preset:

```json
{
  "model": "@preset/ravenel-bridge",
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "What's your opinion of the Golden Gate Bridge? Isn't it beautiful?"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Benefits

### Separation of Concerns

Presets help you maintain a clean separation between your application code and LLM configuration. This makes your code more semantic and easier to maintain.

### Rapid Iteration

Update your LLM configuration without deploying code changes:

* Switch to new model versions
* Adjust system prompts
* Modify parameters
* Change provider preferences

## Using Presets

There are three ways to use presets in your API requests.

1. **Direct Model Reference**

You can reference the preset as if it was a model by sending requests to `@preset/preset-slug`

```json
{
  "model": "@preset/email-copywriter",
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Write a marketing email about our new feature"
    }
  ]
}
```

2. **Preset Field**

```json
{
  "model": "openai/gpt-4",
  "preset": "email-copywriter",
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Write a marketing email about our new feature"
    }
  ]
}
```

3. **Combined Model and Preset**

```json
{
  "model": "openai/gpt-4@preset/email-copywriter",
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Write a marketing email about our new feature"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Other Notes

1. If you're using an organization account, all members can access organization presets. This is a great way to share best practices across teams.
2. Version history is kept in order to understand changes that were made, and to be able to roll back. However when addressing a preset through the API, the latest version is always used.
3. If you provide parameters in the request, they will be shallow-merged with the options configured in the preset.


# Prompt Caching

> Reduce your AI model costs with OpenRouter's prompt caching feature. Learn how to cache and reuse responses across OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, and DeepSeek models.

To save on inference costs, you can enable prompt caching on supported providers and models.

Most providers automatically enable prompt caching, but note that some (see Anthropic below) require you to enable it on a per-message basis.

When using caching (whether automatically in supported models, or via the `cache_control` property), OpenRouter will make a best-effort to continue routing to the same provider to make use of the warm cache. In the event that the provider with your cached prompt is not available, OpenRouter will try the next-best provider.

## Inspecting cache usage

To see how much caching saved on each generation, you can:

1. Click the detail button on the [Activity](/activity) page
2. Use the `/api/v1/generation` API, [documented here](/api-reference/overview#querying-cost-and-stats)
3. Use `usage: {include: true}` in your request to get the cache tokens at the end of the response (see [Usage Accounting](/use-cases/usage-accounting) for details)

The `cache_discount` field in the response body will tell you how much the response saved on cache usage. Some providers, like Anthropic, will have a negative discount on cache writes, but a positive discount (which reduces total cost) on cache reads.

## OpenAI

Caching price changes:

* **Cache writes**: no cost
* **Cache reads**: (depending on the model) charged at 0.25x or 0.50x the price of the original input pricing

[Click here to view OpenAI's cache pricing per model.](https://platform.openai.com/docs/pricing)

Prompt caching with OpenAI is automated and does not require any additional configuration. There is a minimum prompt size of 1024 tokens.

[Click here to read more about OpenAI prompt caching and its limitation.](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-caching)

## Grok

Caching price changes:

* **Cache writes**: no cost
* **Cache reads**: charged at {GROK_CACHE_READ_MULTIPLIER}x the price of the original input pricing

[Click here to view Grok's cache pricing per model.](https://docs.x.ai/docs/models#models-and-pricing)

Prompt caching with Grok is automated and does not require any additional configuration.

## Moonshot AI

Caching price changes:

* **Cache writes**: no cost
* **Cache reads**: charged at {MOONSHOT_CACHE_READ_MULTIPLIER}x the price of the original input pricing

Prompt caching with Moonshot AI is automated and does not require any additional configuration.

[Click here to view Moonshot AI's caching documentation.](https://platform.moonshot.ai/docs/api/caching)

## Groq

Caching price changes:

* **Cache writes**: no cost
* **Cache reads**: charged at {GROQ_CACHE_READ_MULTIPLIER}x the price of the original input pricing

Prompt caching with Groq is automated and does not require any additional configuration. Currently available on Kimi K2 models.

[Click here to view Groq's documentation.](https://console.groq.com/docs/prompt-caching)

## Anthropic Claude

Caching price changes:

* **Cache writes**: charged at {ANTHROPIC_CACHE_WRITE_MULTIPLIER}x the price of the original input pricing
* **Cache reads**: charged at {ANTHROPIC_CACHE_READ_MULTIPLIER}x the price of the original input pricing

Prompt caching with Anthropic requires the use of `cache_control` breakpoints. There is a limit of four breakpoints, and the cache will expire within five minutes. Therefore, it is recommended to reserve the cache breakpoints for large bodies of text, such as character cards, CSV data, RAG data, book chapters, etc.

[Click here to read more about Anthropic prompt caching and its limitation.](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-caching)

The `cache_control` breakpoint can only be inserted into the text part of a multipart message.

System message caching example:

```json
{
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "system",
      "content": [
        {
          "type": "text",
          "text": "You are a historian studying the fall of the Roman Empire. You know the following book very well:"
        },
        {
          "type": "text",
          "text": "HUGE TEXT BODY",
          "cache_control": {
            "type": "ephemeral"
          }
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": [
        {
          "type": "text",
          "text": "What triggered the collapse?"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

User message caching example:

```json
{
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": [
        {
          "type": "text",
          "text": "Given the book below:"
        },
        {
          "type": "text",
          "text": "HUGE TEXT BODY",
          "cache_control": {
            "type": "ephemeral"
          }
        },
        {
          "type": "text",
          "text": "Name all the characters in the above book"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## DeepSeek

Caching price changes:

* **Cache writes**: charged at the same price as the original input pricing
* **Cache reads**: charged at {DEEPSEEK_CACHE_READ_MULTIPLIER}x the price of the original input pricing

Prompt caching with DeepSeek is automated and does not require any additional configuration.

## Google Gemini

### Implicit Caching

Gemini 2.5 Pro and 2.5 Flash models now support **implicit caching**, providing automatic caching functionality similar to OpenAI’s automatic caching. Implicit caching works seamlessly — no manual setup or additional `cache_control` breakpoints required.

Pricing Changes:

* No cache write or storage costs.
* Cached tokens are charged at {GOOGLE_CACHE_READ_MULTIPLIER}x the original input token cost.

Note that the TTL is on average 3-5 minutes, but will vary. There is a minimum of {GOOGLE_CACHE_MIN_TOKENS_2_5_FLASH} tokens for Gemini 2.5 Flash, and {GOOGLE_CACHE_MIN_TOKENS_2_5_PRO} tokens for Gemini 2.5 Pro for requests to be eligible for caching.

[Official announcement from Google](https://developers.googleblog.com/en/gemini-2-5-models-now-support-implicit-caching/)

<Tip>
  To maximize implicit cache hits, keep the initial portion of your message
  arrays consistent between requests. Push variations (such as user questions or
  dynamic context elements) toward the end of your prompt/requests.
</Tip>

### Pricing Changes for Cached Requests:

* **Cache Writes:** Charged at the input token cost plus 5 minutes of cache storage, calculated as follows:

```
Cache write cost = Input token price + (Cache storage price × (5 minutes / 60 minutes))
```

* **Cache Reads:** Charged at {GOOGLE_CACHE_READ_MULTIPLIER}× the original input token cost.

### Supported Models and Limitations:

Only certain Gemini models support caching. Please consult Google's [Gemini API Pricing Documentation](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/pricing) for the most current details.

Cache Writes have a 5 minute Time-to-Live (TTL) that does not update. After 5 minutes, the cache expires and a new cache must be written.

Gemini models have typically have a 4096 token minimum for cache write to occur. Cached tokens count towards the model's maximum token usage. Gemini 2.5 Pro has a minimum of {GOOGLE_CACHE_MIN_TOKENS_2_5_PRO} tokens, and Gemini 2.5 Flash has a minimum of {GOOGLE_CACHE_MIN_TOKENS_2_5_FLASH} tokens.

### How Gemini Prompt Caching works on OpenRouter:

OpenRouter simplifies Gemini cache management, abstracting away complexities:

* You **do not** need to manually create, update, or delete caches.
* You **do not** need to manage cache names or TTL explicitly.

### How to Enable Gemini Prompt Caching:

Gemini caching in OpenRouter requires you to insert `cache_control` breakpoints explicitly within message content, similar to Anthropic. We recommend using caching primarily for large content pieces (such as CSV files, lengthy character cards, retrieval augmented generation (RAG) data, or extensive textual sources).

<Tip>
  There is not a limit on the number of `cache_control` breakpoints you can
  include in your request. OpenRouter will use only the last breakpoint for
  Gemini caching. Including multiple breakpoints is safe and can help maintain
  compatibility with Anthropic, but only the final one will be used for Gemini.
</Tip>

### Examples:

#### System Message Caching Example

```json
{
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "system",
      "content": [
        {
          "type": "text",
          "text": "You are a historian studying the fall of the Roman Empire. Below is an extensive reference book:"
        },
        {
          "type": "text",
          "text": "HUGE TEXT BODY HERE",
          "cache_control": {
            "type": "ephemeral"
          }
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": [
        {
          "type": "text",
          "text": "What triggered the collapse?"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### User Message Caching Example

```json
{
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": [
        {
          "type": "text",
          "text": "Based on the book text below:"
        },
        {
          "type": "text",
          "text": "HUGE TEXT BODY HERE",
          "cache_control": {
            "type": "ephemeral"
          }
        },
        {
          "type": "text",
          "text": "List all main characters mentioned in the text above."
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```


# Structured Outputs

> Enforce JSON Schema validation on AI model responses. Get consistent, type-safe outputs and avoid parsing errors with OpenRouter's structured output feature.

OpenRouter supports structured outputs for compatible models, ensuring responses follow a specific JSON Schema format. This feature is particularly useful when you need consistent, well-formatted responses that can be reliably parsed by your application.

## Overview

Structured outputs allow you to:

* Enforce specific JSON Schema validation on model responses
* Get consistent, type-safe outputs
* Avoid parsing errors and hallucinated fields
* Simplify response handling in your application

## Using Structured Outputs

To use structured outputs, include a `response_format` parameter in your request, with `type` set to `json_schema` and the `json_schema` object containing your schema:

```typescript
{
  "messages": [
    { "role": "user", "content": "What's the weather like in London?" }
  ],
  "response_format": {
    "type": "json_schema",
    "json_schema": {
      "name": "weather",
      "strict": true,
      "schema": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "location": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "City or location name"
          },
          "temperature": {
            "type": "number",
            "description": "Temperature in Celsius"
          },
          "conditions": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "Weather conditions description"
          }
        },
        "required": ["location", "temperature", "conditions"],
        "additionalProperties": false
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The model will respond with a JSON object that strictly follows your schema:

```json
{
  "location": "London",
  "temperature": 18,
  "conditions": "Partly cloudy with light drizzle"
}
```

## Model Support

Structured outputs are supported by select models.

You can find a list of models that support structured outputs on the [models page](https://openrouter.ai/models?order=newest\&supported_parameters=structured_outputs).

* OpenAI models (GPT-4o and later versions) [Docs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs)
* Google Gemini models [Docs](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/structured-output)
* Most open-source models
* All Fireworks provided models [Docs](https://docs.fireworks.ai/structured-responses/structured-response-formatting#structured-response-modes)

To ensure your chosen model supports structured outputs:

1. Check the model's supported parameters on the [models page](https://openrouter.ai/models)
2. Set `require_parameters: true` in your provider preferences (see [Provider Routing](/docs/features/provider-routing))
3. Include `response_format` and set `type: json_schema` in the required parameters

## Best Practices

1. **Include descriptions**: Add clear descriptions to your schema properties to guide the model

2. **Use strict mode**: Always set `strict: true` to ensure the model follows your schema exactly

## Example Implementation

Here's a complete example using the Fetch API:

<Template
  data={{
  API_KEY_REF,
  MODEL: 'openai/gpt-4'
}}
>
  <CodeGroup>
    ```typescript title="TypeScript SDK"
    import { OpenRouter } from '@openrouter/sdk';

    const openRouter = new OpenRouter({
      apiKey: '{{API_KEY_REF}}',
    });

    const response = await openRouter.chat.send({
      model: '{{MODEL}}',
      messages: [
        { role: 'user', content: 'What is the weather like in London?' },
      ],
      responseFormat: {
        type: 'json_schema',
        jsonSchema: {
          name: 'weather',
          strict: true,
          schema: {
            type: 'object',
            properties: {
              location: {
                type: 'string',
                description: 'City or location name',
              },
              temperature: {
                type: 'number',
                description: 'Temperature in Celsius',
              },
              conditions: {
                type: 'string',
                description: 'Weather conditions description',
              },
            },
            required: ['location', 'temperature', 'conditions'],
            additionalProperties: false,
          },
        },
      },
      stream: false,
    });

    const weatherInfo = response.choices[0].message.content;
    ```

    ```python title="Python"
    import requests
    import json

    response = requests.post(
      "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions",
      headers={
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {{API_KEY_REF}}",
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
      },

      json={
        "model": "{{MODEL}}",
        "messages": [
          {"role": "user", "content": "What is the weather like in London?"},
        ],
        "response_format": {
          "type": "json_schema",
          "json_schema": {
            "name": "weather",
            "strict": True,
            "schema": {
              "type": "object",
              "properties": {
                "location": {
                  "type": "string",
                  "description": "City or location name",
                },
                "temperature": {
                  "type": "number",
                  "description": "Temperature in Celsius",
                },
                "conditions": {
                  "type": "string",
                  "description": "Weather conditions description",
                },
              },
              "required": ["location", "temperature", "conditions"],
              "additionalProperties": False,
            },
          },
        },
      },
    )

    data = response.json()
    weather_info = data["choices"][0]["message"]["content"]
    ```

    ```typescript title="TypeScript (fetch)"
    const response = await fetch('https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        Authorization: 'Bearer {{API_KEY_REF}}',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        model: '{{MODEL}}',
        messages: [
          { role: 'user', content: 'What is the weather like in London?' },
        ],
        response_format: {
          type: 'json_schema',
          json_schema: {
            name: 'weather',
            strict: true,
            schema: {
              type: 'object',
              properties: {
                location: {
                  type: 'string',
                  description: 'City or location name',
                },
                temperature: {
                  type: 'number',
                  description: 'Temperature in Celsius',
                },
                conditions: {
                  type: 'string',
                  description: 'Weather conditions description',
                },
              },
              required: ['location', 'temperature', 'conditions'],
              additionalProperties: false,
            },
          },
        },
      }),
    });

    const data = await response.json();
    const weatherInfo = data.choices[0].message.content;
    ```
  </CodeGroup>
</Template>

## Streaming with Structured Outputs

Structured outputs are also supported with streaming responses. The model will stream valid partial JSON that, when complete, forms a valid response matching your schema.

To enable streaming with structured outputs, simply add `stream: true` to your request:

```typescript
{
  "stream": true,
  "response_format": {
    "type": "json_schema",
    // ... rest of your schema
  }
}
```

## Error Handling

When using structured outputs, you may encounter these scenarios:

1. **Model doesn't support structured outputs**: The request will fail with an error indicating lack of support
2. **Invalid schema**: The model will return an error if your JSON Schema is invalid


# Tool & Function Calling

> Use tools (or functions) in your prompts with OpenRouter. Learn how to use tools with OpenAI, Anthropic, and other models that support tool calling.

Tool calls (also known as function calls) give an LLM access to external tools. The LLM does not call the tools directly. Instead, it suggests the tool to call. The user then calls the tool separately and provides the results back to the LLM. Finally, the LLM formats the response into an answer to the user's original question.

OpenRouter standardizes the tool calling interface across models and providers, making it easy to integrate external tools with any supported model.

**Supported Models**: You can find models that support tool calling by filtering on [openrouter.ai/models?supported\_parameters=tools](https://openrouter.ai/models?supported_parameters=tools).

If you prefer to learn from a full end-to-end example, keep reading.

## Request Body Examples

Tool calling with OpenRouter involves three key steps. Here are the essential request body formats for each step:

### Step 1: Inference Request with Tools

```json
{
  "model": "google/gemini-2.0-flash-001",
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "What are the titles of some James Joyce books?"
    }
  ],
  "tools": [
    {
      "type": "function",
      "function": {
        "name": "search_gutenberg_books",
        "description": "Search for books in the Project Gutenberg library",
        "parameters": {
          "type": "object",
          "properties": {
            "search_terms": {
              "type": "array",
              "items": {"type": "string"},
              "description": "List of search terms to find books"
            }
          },
          "required": ["search_terms"]
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Step 2: Tool Execution (Client-Side)

After receiving the model's response with `tool_calls`, execute the requested tool locally and prepare the result:

```javascript
// Model responds with tool_calls, you execute the tool locally
const toolResult = await searchGutenbergBooks(["James", "Joyce"]);
```

### Step 3: Inference Request with Tool Results

```json
{
  "model": "google/gemini-2.0-flash-001",
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "What are the titles of some James Joyce books?"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": null,
      "tool_calls": [
        {
          "id": "call_abc123",
          "type": "function",
          "function": {
            "name": "search_gutenberg_books",
            "arguments": "{\"search_terms\": [\"James\", \"Joyce\"]}"
          }
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "role": "tool",
      "tool_call_id": "call_abc123",
      "content": "[{\"id\": 4300, \"title\": \"Ulysses\", \"authors\": [{\"name\": \"Joyce, James\"}]}]"
    }
  ],
  "tools": [
    {
      "type": "function",
      "function": {
        "name": "search_gutenberg_books",
        "description": "Search for books in the Project Gutenberg library",
        "parameters": {
          "type": "object",
          "properties": {
            "search_terms": {
              "type": "array",
              "items": {"type": "string"},
              "description": "List of search terms to find books"
            }
          },
          "required": ["search_terms"]
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Note**: The `tools` parameter must be included in every request (Steps 1 and 3) so the router can validate the tool schema on each call.

### Tool Calling Example

Here is Python code that gives LLMs the ability to call an external API -- in this case Project Gutenberg, to search for books.

First, let's do some basic setup:

<Template
  data={{
  API_KEY_REF,
  MODEL: 'google/gemini-2.0-flash-001'
}}
>
  <CodeGroup>
    ```typescript title="TypeScript SDK"
    import { OpenRouter } from '@openrouter/sdk';

    const OPENROUTER_API_KEY = "{{API_KEY_REF}}";

    // You can use any model that supports tool calling
    const MODEL = "{{MODEL}}";

    const openRouter = new OpenRouter({
      apiKey: OPENROUTER_API_KEY,
    });

    const task = "What are the titles of some James Joyce books?";

    const messages = [
      {
        role: "system",
        content: "You are a helpful assistant."
      },
      {
        role: "user",
        content: task,
      }
    ];
    ```

    ```python
    import json, requests
    from openai import OpenAI

    OPENROUTER_API_KEY = f"{{API_KEY_REF}}"

    # You can use any model that supports tool calling
    MODEL = "{{MODEL}}"

    openai_client = OpenAI(
      base_url="https://openrouter.ai/api/v1",
      api_key=OPENROUTER_API_KEY,
    )

    task = "What are the titles of some James Joyce books?"

    messages = [
      {
        "role": "system",
        "content": "You are a helpful assistant."
      },
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": task,
      }
    ]

    ```

    ```typescript title="TypeScript (fetch)"
    const response = await fetch('https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        Authorization: `Bearer {{API_KEY_REF}}`,
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        model: '{{MODEL}}',
        messages: [
          { role: 'system', content: 'You are a helpful assistant.' },
          {
            role: 'user',
            content: 'What are the titles of some James Joyce books?',
          },
        ],
      }),
    });
    ```
  </CodeGroup>
</Template>

### Define the Tool

Next, we define the tool that we want to call. Remember, the tool is going to get *requested* by the LLM, but the code we are writing here is ultimately responsible for executing the call and returning the results to the LLM.

<Template
  data={{
  API_KEY_REF,
  MODEL: 'google/gemini-2.0-flash-001'
}}
>
  <CodeGroup>
    ```typescript title="TypeScript SDK"
    async function searchGutenbergBooks(searchTerms: string[]): Promise<Book[]> {
      const searchQuery = searchTerms.join(' ');
      const url = 'https://gutendex.com/books';
      const response = await fetch(`${url}?search=${searchQuery}`);
      const data = await response.json();

      return data.results.map((book: any) => ({
        id: book.id,
        title: book.title,
        authors: book.authors,
      }));
    }

    const tools = [
      {
        type: 'function',
        function: {
          name: 'searchGutenbergBooks',
          description:
            'Search for books in the Project Gutenberg library based on specified search terms',
          parameters: {
            type: 'object',
            properties: {
              search_terms: {
                type: 'array',
                items: {
                  type: 'string',
                },
                description:
                  "List of search terms to find books in the Gutenberg library (e.g. ['dickens', 'great'] to search for books by Dickens with 'great' in the title)",
              },
            },
            required: ['search_terms'],
          },
        },
      },
    ];

    const TOOL_MAPPING = {
      searchGutenbergBooks,
    };
    ```

    ```python
    def search_gutenberg_books(search_terms):
        search_query = " ".join(search_terms)
        url = "https://gutendex.com/books"
        response = requests.get(url, params={"search": search_query})

        simplified_results = []
        for book in response.json().get("results", []):
            simplified_results.append({
                "id": book.get("id"),
                "title": book.get("title"),
                "authors": book.get("authors")
            })

        return simplified_results

    tools = [
      {
        "type": "function",
        "function": {
          "name": "search_gutenberg_books",
          "description": "Search for books in the Project Gutenberg library based on specified search terms",
          "parameters": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
              "search_terms": {
                "type": "array",
                "items": {
                  "type": "string"
                },
                "description": "List of search terms to find books in the Gutenberg library (e.g. ['dickens', 'great'] to search for books by Dickens with 'great' in the title)"
              }
            },
            "required": ["search_terms"]
          }
        }
      }
    ]

    TOOL_MAPPING = {
        "search_gutenberg_books": search_gutenberg_books
    }

    ```
  </CodeGroup>
</Template>

Note that the "tool" is just a normal function. We then write a JSON "spec" compatible with the OpenAI function calling parameter. We'll pass that spec to the LLM so that it knows this tool is available and how to use it. It will request the tool when needed, along with any arguments. We'll then marshal the tool call locally, make the function call, and return the results to the LLM.

### Tool use and tool results

Let's make the first OpenRouter API call to the model:

<Template
  data={{
  API_KEY_REF,
  MODEL: 'google/gemini-2.0-flash-001'
}}
>
  <CodeGroup>
    ```typescript title="TypeScript SDK"
    const result = await openRouter.chat.send({
      model: '{{MODEL}}',
      tools,
      messages,
      stream: false,
    });

    const response_1 = result.choices[0].message;
    ```

    ```python
    request_1 = {
        "model": {{MODEL}},
        "tools": tools,
        "messages": messages
    }

    response_1 = openai_client.chat.completions.create(**request_1).message
    ```

    ```typescript title="TypeScript (fetch)"
    const request_1 = await fetch('https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        Authorization: `Bearer {{API_KEY_REF}}`,
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        model: '{{MODEL}}',
        tools,
        messages,
      }),
    });

    const data = await request_1.json();
    const response_1 = data.choices[0].message;
    ```
  </CodeGroup>
</Template>

The LLM responds with a finish reason of `tool_calls`, and a `tool_calls` array. In a generic LLM response-handler, you would want to check the `finish_reason` before processing tool calls, but here we will assume it's the case. Let's keep going, by processing the tool call:

<Template
  data={{
  API_KEY_REF,
  MODEL: 'google/gemini-2.0-flash-001'
}}
>
  <CodeGroup>
    ```typescript title="TypeScript SDK"
    // Append the response to the messages array so the LLM has the full context
    // It's easy to forget this step!
    messages.push(response_1);

    // Now we process the requested tool calls, and use our book lookup tool
    for (const toolCall of response_1.tool_calls) {
      const toolName = toolCall.function.name;
      const { search_params } = JSON.parse(toolCall.function.arguments);
      const toolResponse = await TOOL_MAPPING[toolName](search_params);
      messages.push({
        role: 'tool',
        toolCallId: toolCall.id,
        name: toolName,
        content: JSON.stringify(toolResponse),
      });
    }
    ```

    ```python
    # Append the response to the messages array so the LLM has the full context
    # It's easy to forget this step!
    messages.append(response_1)

    # Now we process the requested tool calls, and use our book lookup tool
    for tool_call in response_1.tool_calls:
        '''
        In this case we only provided one tool, so we know what function to call.
        When providing multiple tools, you can inspect `tool_call.function.name`
        to figure out what function you need to call locally.
        '''
        tool_name = tool_call.function.name
        tool_args = json.loads(tool_call.function.arguments)
        tool_response = TOOL_MAPPING[tool_name](**tool_args)
        messages.append({
          "role": "tool",
          "tool_call_id": tool_call.id,
          "content": json.dumps(tool_response),
        })
    ```
  </CodeGroup>
</Template>

The messages array now has:

1. Our original request
2. The LLM's response (containing a tool call request)
3. The result of the tool call (a json object returned from the Project Gutenberg API)

Now, we can make a second OpenRouter API call, and hopefully get our result!

<Template
  data={{
  API_KEY_REF,
  MODEL: 'google/gemini-2.0-flash-001'
}}
>
  <CodeGroup>
    ```typescript title="TypeScript SDK"
    const response_2 = await openRouter.chat.send({
      model: '{{MODEL}}',
      messages,
      tools,
      stream: false,
    });

    console.log(response_2.choices[0].message.content);
    ```

    ```python
    request_2 = {
      "model": MODEL,
      "messages": messages,
      "tools": tools
    }

    response_2 = openai_client.chat.completions.create(**request_2)

    print(response_2.choices[0].message.content)
    ```

    ```typescript title="TypeScript (fetch)"
    const response = await fetch('https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        Authorization: `Bearer {{API_KEY_REF}}`,
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        model: '{{MODEL}}',
        messages,
        tools,
      }),
    });

    const data = await response.json();
    console.log(data.choices[0].message.content);
    ```
  </CodeGroup>
</Template>

The output will be something like:

```text
Here are some books by James Joyce:

*   *Ulysses*
*   *Dubliners*
*   *A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man*
*   *Chamber Music*
*   *Exiles: A Play in Three Acts*
```

We did it! We've successfully used a tool in a prompt.

## Interleaved Thinking

Interleaved thinking allows models to reason between tool calls, enabling more sophisticated decision-making after receiving tool results. This feature helps models chain multiple tool calls with reasoning steps in between and make nuanced decisions based on intermediate results.

**Important**: Interleaved thinking increases token usage and response latency. Consider your budget and performance requirements when enabling this feature.

### How Interleaved Thinking Works

With interleaved thinking, the model can:

* Reason about the results of a tool call before deciding what to do next
* Chain multiple tool calls with reasoning steps in between
* Make more nuanced decisions based on intermediate results
* Provide transparent reasoning for its tool selection process

### Example: Multi-Step Research with Reasoning

Here's an example showing how a model might use interleaved thinking to research a topic across multiple sources:

**Initial Request:**

```json
{
  "model": "anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet",
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Research the environmental impact of electric vehicles and provide a comprehensive analysis."
    }
  ],
  "tools": [
    {
      "type": "function",
      "function": {
        "name": "search_academic_papers",
        "description": "Search for academic papers on a given topic",
        "parameters": {
          "type": "object",
          "properties": {
            "query": {"type": "string"},
            "field": {"type": "string"}
          },
          "required": ["query"]
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "function",
      "function": {
        "name": "get_latest_statistics",
        "description": "Get latest statistics on a topic",
        "parameters": {
          "type": "object",
          "properties": {
            "topic": {"type": "string"},
            "year": {"type": "integer"}
          },
          "required": ["topic"]
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Model's Reasoning and Tool Calls:**

1. **Initial Thinking**: "I need to research electric vehicle environmental impact. Let me start with academic papers to get peer-reviewed research."

2. **First Tool Call**: `search_academic_papers({"query": "electric vehicle lifecycle environmental impact", "field": "environmental science"})`

3. **After First Tool Result**: "The papers show mixed results on manufacturing impact. I need current statistics to complement this academic research."

4. **Second Tool Call**: `get_latest_statistics({"topic": "electric vehicle carbon footprint", "year": 2024})`

5. **After Second Tool Result**: "Now I have both academic research and current data. Let me search for manufacturing-specific studies to address the gaps I found."

6. **Third Tool Call**: `search_academic_papers({"query": "electric vehicle battery manufacturing environmental cost", "field": "materials science"})`

7. **Final Analysis**: Synthesizes all gathered information into a comprehensive response.

### Best Practices for Interleaved Thinking

* **Clear Tool Descriptions**: Provide detailed descriptions so the model can reason about when to use each tool
* **Structured Parameters**: Use well-defined parameter schemas to help the model make precise tool calls
* **Context Preservation**: Maintain conversation context across multiple tool interactions
* **Error Handling**: Design tools to provide meaningful error messages that help the model adjust its approach

### Implementation Considerations

When implementing interleaved thinking:

* Models may take longer to respond due to additional reasoning steps
* Token usage will be higher due to the reasoning process
* The quality of reasoning depends on the model's capabilities
* Some models may be better suited for this approach than others

## A Simple Agentic Loop

In the example above, the calls are made explicitly and sequentially. To handle a wide variety of user inputs and tool calls, you can use an agentic loop.

Here's an example of a simple agentic loop (using the same `tools` and initial `messages` as above):

<Template
  data={{
  API_KEY_REF,
  MODEL: 'google/gemini-2.0-flash-001'
}}
>
  <CodeGroup>
    ```typescript title="TypeScript SDK"
    async function callLLM(messages: Message[]): Promise<ChatResponse> {
      const result = await openRouter.chat.send({
        model: '{{MODEL}}',
        tools,
        messages,
        stream: false,
      });

      messages.push(result.choices[0].message);
      return result;
    }

    async function getToolResponse(response: ChatResponse): Promise<Message> {
      const toolCall = response.choices[0].message.toolCalls[0];
      const toolName = toolCall.function.name;
      const toolArgs = JSON.parse(toolCall.function.arguments);

      // Look up the correct tool locally, and call it with the provided arguments
      // Other tools can be added without changing the agentic loop
      const toolResult = await TOOL_MAPPING[toolName](toolArgs);

      return {
        role: 'tool',
        toolCallId: toolCall.id,
        content: toolResult,
      };
    }

    const maxIterations = 10;
    let iterationCount = 0;

    while (iterationCount < maxIterations) {
      iterationCount++;
      const response = await callLLM(messages);

      if (response.choices[0].message.toolCalls) {
        messages.push(await getToolResponse(response));
      } else {
        break;
      }
    }

    if (iterationCount >= maxIterations) {
      console.warn("Warning: Maximum iterations reached");
    }

    console.log(messages[messages.length - 1].content);
    ```

    ```python

    def call_llm(msgs):
        resp = openai_client.chat.completions.create(
            model={{MODEL}},
            tools=tools,
            messages=msgs
        )
        msgs.append(resp.choices[0].message.dict())
        return resp

    def get_tool_response(response):
        tool_call = response.choices[0].message.tool_calls[0]
        tool_name = tool_call.function.name
        tool_args = json.loads(tool_call.function.arguments)

        # Look up the correct tool locally, and call it with the provided arguments
        # Other tools can be added without changing the agentic loop
        tool_result = TOOL_MAPPING[tool_name](**tool_args)

        return {
            "role": "tool",
            "tool_call_id": tool_call.id,
            "content": tool_result,
        }

    max_iterations = 10
    iteration_count = 0

    while iteration_count < max_iterations:
        iteration_count += 1
        resp = call_llm(_messages)

        if resp.choices[0].message.tool_calls is not None:
            messages.append(get_tool_response(resp))
        else:
            break

    if iteration_count >= max_iterations:
        print("Warning: Maximum iterations reached")

    print(messages[-1]['content'])

    ```
  </CodeGroup>
</Template>

## Best Practices and Advanced Patterns

### Function Definition Guidelines

When defining tools for LLMs, follow these best practices:

**Clear and Descriptive Names**: Use descriptive function names that clearly indicate the tool's purpose.

```json
// Good: Clear and specific
{ "name": "get_weather_forecast" }
```

```json
// Avoid: Too vague
{ "name": "weather" }
```

**Comprehensive Descriptions**: Provide detailed descriptions that help the model understand when and how to use the tool.

```json
{
  "description": "Get current weather conditions and 5-day forecast for a specific location. Supports cities, zip codes, and coordinates.",
  "parameters": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "location": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "City name, zip code, or coordinates (lat,lng). Examples: 'New York', '10001', '40.7128,-74.0060'"
      },
      "units": {
        "type": "string",
        "enum": ["celsius", "fahrenheit"],
        "description": "Temperature unit preference",
        "default": "celsius"
      }
    },
    "required": ["location"]
  }
}
```

### Streaming with Tool Calls

When using streaming responses with tool calls, handle the different content types appropriately:

```typescript
const stream = await fetch('/api/chat/completions', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    model: 'anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet',
    messages: messages,
    tools: tools,
    stream: true
  })
});

const reader = stream.body.getReader();
let toolCalls = [];

while (true) {
  const { done, value } = await reader.read();
  if (done) {
    break;
  }

  const chunk = new TextDecoder().decode(value);
  const lines = chunk.split('\n').filter(line => line.trim());

  for (const line of lines) {
    if (line.startsWith('data: ')) {
      const data = JSON.parse(line.slice(6));

      if (data.choices[0].delta.tool_calls) {
        toolCalls.push(...data.choices[0].delta.tool_calls);
      }

      if (data.choices[0].delta.finish_reason === 'tool_calls') {
        await handleToolCalls(toolCalls);
      } else if (data.choices[0].delta.finish_reason === 'stop') {
        // Regular completion without tool calls
        break;
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Tool Choice Configuration

Control tool usage with the `tool_choice` parameter:

```json
// Let model decide (default)
{ "tool_choice": "auto" }
```

```json
// Disable tool usage
{ "tool_choice": "none" }
```

```json
// Force specific tool
{
  "tool_choice": {
    "type": "function",
    "function": {"name": "search_database"}
  }
}
```

### Parallel Tool Calls

Control whether multiple tools can be called simultaneously with the `parallel_tool_calls` parameter (default is true for most models):

```json
// Disable parallel tool calls - tools will be called sequentially
{ "parallel_tool_calls": false }
```

When `parallel_tool_calls` is `false`, the model will only request one tool call at a time instead of potentially multiple calls in parallel.

### Multi-Tool Workflows

Design tools that work well together:

```json
{
  "tools": [
    {
      "type": "function",
      "function": {
        "name": "search_products",
        "description": "Search for products in the catalog"
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "function",
      "function": {
        "name": "get_product_details",
        "description": "Get detailed information about a specific product"
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "function",
      "function": {
        "name": "check_inventory",
        "description": "Check current inventory levels for a product"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

This allows the model to naturally chain operations: search → get details → check inventory.

# Multimodal Capabilities

> Send images, PDFs, audio, and video to OpenRouter models through our unified API.

OpenRouter supports multiple input modalities beyond text, allowing you to send images, PDFs, audio, and video files to compatible models through our unified API. This enables rich multimodal interactions for a wide variety of use cases.

## Supported Modalities

### Images

Send images to vision-capable models for analysis, description, OCR, and more. OpenRouter supports multiple image formats and both URL-based and base64-encoded images.

[Learn more about image inputs →](/docs/features/multimodal/images)

### Image Generation

Generate images from text prompts using AI models with image output capabilities. OpenRouter supports various image generation models that can create high-quality images based on your descriptions.

[Learn more about image generation →](/docs/features/multimodal/image-generation)

### PDFs

Process PDF documents with any model on OpenRouter. Our intelligent PDF parsing system extracts text and handles both text-based and scanned documents.

[Learn more about PDF processing →](/docs/features/multimodal/pdfs)

### Audio

Send audio files to speech-capable models for transcription, analysis, and processing. OpenRouter supports common audio formats with automatic routing to compatible models.

[Learn more about audio inputs →](/docs/features/multimodal/audio)

### Video

Send video files to video-capable models for analysis, description, object detection, and action recognition. OpenRouter supports multiple video formats for comprehensive video understanding tasks.

[Learn more about video inputs →](/docs/features/multimodal/videos)

## Getting Started

All multimodal inputs use the same `/api/v1/chat/completions` endpoint with the `messages` parameter. Different content types are specified in the message content array:

* **Images**: Use `image_url` content type
* **PDFs**: Use `file` content type with PDF data
* **Audio**: Use `input_audio` content type
* **Video**: Use `input_video` content type

You can combine multiple modalities in a single request, and the number of files you can send varies by provider and model.

## Model Compatibility

Not all models support every modality. OpenRouter automatically filters available models based on your request content:

* **Vision models**: Required for image processing
* **File-compatible models**: Can process PDFs natively or through our parsing system
* **Audio-capable models**: Required for audio input processing
* **Video-capable models**: Required for video input processing

Use our [Models page](https://openrouter.ai/models) to find models that support your desired input modalities.

## Input Format Support

OpenRouter supports both **direct URLs** and **base64-encoded data** for multimodal inputs:

### URLs (Recommended for public content)

* **Images**: `https://example.com/image.jpg`
* **PDFs**: `https://example.com/document.pdf`
* **Audio**: Not supported via URL (base64 only)
* **Video**: Provider-specific (e.g., YouTube links for Gemini on AI Studio)

### Base64 Encoding (Required for local files)

* **Images**: `data:image/jpeg;base64,{base64_data}`
* **PDFs**: `data:application/pdf;base64,{base64_data}`
* **Audio**: Raw base64 string with format specification
* **Video**: `data:video/mp4;base64,{base64_data}`

<Info>
  URLs are more efficient for large files as they don't require local encoding and reduce request payload size. Base64 encoding is required for local files or when the content is not publicly accessible.

  **Note for video URLs**: Video URL support varies by provider. For example, Google Gemini on AI Studio only supports YouTube links. See the [video inputs documentation](/docs/features/multimodal/videos) for provider-specific details.
</Info>

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I mix different modalities in one request?">
    Yes! You can send text, images, PDFs, audio, and video in the same request. The model will process all inputs together.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How is multimodal content priced?">
    * **Images**: Typically priced per image or as input tokens
    * **PDFs**: Free text extraction, paid OCR processing, or native model pricing
    * **Audio**: Priced as input tokens based on duration
    * **Video**: Priced as input tokens based on duration and resolution
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Which models support video input?">
    Video support varies by model. Use the [Models page](/models?fmt=cards\&input_modalities=video) to filter for video-capable models. Check each model's documentation for specific video format and duration limits.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>


# Image Inputs

> Send images to vision models through the OpenRouter API.

Requests with images, to multimodel models, are available via the `/api/v1/chat/completions` API with a multi-part `messages` parameter. The `image_url` can either be a URL or a base64-encoded image. Note that multiple images can be sent in separate content array entries. The number of images you can send in a single request varies per provider and per model. Due to how the content is parsed, we recommend sending the text prompt first, then the images. If the images must come first, we recommend putting it in the system prompt.

OpenRouter supports both **direct URLs** and **base64-encoded data** for images:

* **URLs**: More efficient for publicly accessible images as they don't require local encoding
* **Base64**: Required for local files or private images that aren't publicly accessible

### Using Image URLs

Here's how to send an image using a URL:

<Template
  data={{
  API_KEY_REF,
  MODEL: 'google/gemini-2.0-flash-001'
}}
>
  <CodeGroup>
    ```typescript title="TypeScript SDK"
    import { OpenRouter } from '@openrouter/sdk';

    const openRouter = new OpenRouter({
      apiKey: '{{API_KEY_REF}}',
    });

    const result = await openRouter.chat.send({
      model: '{{MODEL}}',
      messages: [
        {
          role: 'user',
          content: [
            {
              type: 'text',
              text: "What's in this image?",
            },
            {
              type: 'image_url',
              imageUrl: {
                url: 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/Gfp-wisconsin-madison-the-nature-boardwalk.jpg/2560px-Gfp-wisconsin-madison-the-nature-boardwalk.jpg',
              },
            },
          ],
        },
      ],
      stream: false,
    });

    console.log(result);
    ```

    ```python
    import requests
    import json

    url = "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions"
    headers = {
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {API_KEY_REF}",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }

    messages = [
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": [
                {
                    "type": "text",
                    "text": "What's in this image?"
                },
                {
                    "type": "image_url",
                    "image_url": {
                        "url": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/Gfp-wisconsin-madison-the-nature-boardwalk.jpg/2560px-Gfp-wisconsin-madison-the-nature-boardwalk.jpg"
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    ]

    payload = {
        "model": "{{MODEL}}",
        "messages": messages
    }

    response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload)
    print(response.json())
    ```

    ```typescript title="TypeScript (fetch)"
    const response = await fetch('https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        Authorization: `Bearer ${API_KEY_REF}`,
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',

### Using Base64 Encoded Images

For locally stored images, you can send them using base64 encoding. Here's how to do it:

<Template
  data={{
  API_KEY_REF,
  MODEL: 'google/gemini-2.0-flash-001'
}}
>
  <CodeGroup>
    ```typescript title="TypeScript SDK"
    import { OpenRouter } from '@openrouter/sdk';
    import * as fs from 'fs';

    const openRouter = new OpenRouter({
      apiKey: '{{API_KEY_REF}}',
    });

    async function encodeImageToBase64(imagePath: string): Promise<string> {
      const imageBuffer = await fs.promises.readFile(imagePath);
      const base64Image = imageBuffer.toString('base64');
      return `data:image/jpeg;base64,${base64Image}`;
    }

    // Read and encode the image
    const imagePath = 'path/to/your/image.jpg';
    const base64Image = await encodeImageToBase64(imagePath);

    const result = await openRouter.chat.send({
      model: '{{MODEL}}',
      messages: [
        {
          role: 'user',
          content: [
            {
              type: 'text',
              text: "What's in this image?",
            },
            {
              type: 'image_url',
              imageUrl: {
                url: base64Image,
              },
            },
          ],
        },
      ],
      stream: false,
    });

    console.log(result);
    ```

    ```python
    import requests
    import json
    import base64
    from pathlib import Path

    def encode_image_to_base64(image_path):
        with open(image_path, "rb") as image_file:
            return base64.b64encode(image_file.read()).decode('utf-8')

    url = "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions"
    headers = {
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {API_KEY_REF}",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }

    # Read and encode the image
    image_path = "path/to/your/image.jpg"
    base64_image = encode_image_to_base64(image_path)
    data_url = f"data:image/jpeg;base64,{base64_image}"

    messages = [
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": [
                {
                    "type": "text",
                    "text": "What's in this image?"
                },
                {
                    "type": "image_url",
                    "image_url": {
                        "url": data_url
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    ]

    payload = {
        "model": "{{MODEL}}",
        "messages": messages
    }

    response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload)
    print(response.json())
    ```

    ```typescript title="TypeScript (fetch)"
    async function encodeImageToBase64(imagePath: string): Promise<string> {
      const imageBuffer = await fs.promises.readFile(imagePath);
      const base64Image = imageBuffer.toString('base64');
      return `data:image/jpeg;base64,${base64Image}`;
    }

    // Read and encode the image
    const imagePath = 'path/to/your/image.jpg';
    const base64Image = await encodeImageToBase64(imagePath);

    const response = await fetch('https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        Authorization: `Bearer ${API_KEY_REF}`,
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        model: '{{MODEL}}',
        messages: [
          {
            role: 'user',
            content: [
              {
                type: 'text',
                text: "What's in this image?",
              },
              {
                type: 'image_url',
                image_url: {
                  url: base64Image,
                },
              },
            ],
          },
        ],
      }),
    });

    const data = await response.json();
    console.log(data);
    ```
  </CodeGroup>
</Template>

Supported image content types are:

* `image/png`
* `image/jpeg`
* `image/webp`
* `image/gif`
