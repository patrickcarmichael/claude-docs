## Model Support

Structured outputs are supported by select models.

You can find a list of models that support structured outputs on the [models page](https://openrouter.ai/models?order=newest\&supported_parameters=structured_outputs).

* OpenAI models (GPT-4o and later versions) [Docs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs)
* Google Gemini models [Docs](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/structured-output)
* Most open-source models
* All Fireworks provided models [Docs](https://docs.fireworks.ai/structured-responses/structured-response-formatting#structured-response-modes)

To ensure your chosen model supports structured outputs:

1. Check the model's supported parameters on the [models page](https://openrouter.ai/models)
2. Set `require_parameters: true` in your provider preferences (see [Provider Routing](/docs/features/provider-routing))
3. Include `response_format` and set `type: json_schema` in the required parameters
