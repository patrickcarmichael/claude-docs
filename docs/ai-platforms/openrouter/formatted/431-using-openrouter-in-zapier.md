## Using OpenRouter in Zapier

Once you've set up the integration, you can use OpenRouter in your Zaps to:

* **Generate content** with models like GPT-4, Claude, or Gemini
* **Analyze data** using specialized models for different domains
* **Process images** with vision-capable models
* **Create structured outputs** with JSON mode and function calling
* **Stream responses** for real-time applications

The OpenRouter Zapier integration automatically handles authentication, model routing, and error handling, so you can focus on building your automation logic.

For more advanced use cases and detailed documentation, visit the [OpenRouter Zapier integration page](https://zapier.com/apps/openrouter/integrations).
