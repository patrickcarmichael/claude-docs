## Enterprise EU in-region routing

For enterprise customers, OpenRouter supports EU in-region routing. When enabled for your account, your prompts and completions are processed within the European Union and do not leave the EU. Use the base URL [http://eu.openrouter.ai](http://eu.openrouter.ai) for API requests to keep traffic and data within Europe. This feature is only enabled for enterprise customers by request.

If you’re interested, please contact our enterprise team at [https://openrouter.ai/enterprise/form](https://openrouter.ai/enterprise/form).
