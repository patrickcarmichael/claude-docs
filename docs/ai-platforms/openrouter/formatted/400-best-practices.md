## Best Practices

### Choose Stable Identifiers

Use consistent, stable identifiers for the same user across requests:

* **Good**: `user_12345`, `customer_abc123`, `account_xyz789`
* **Avoid**: Random strings that change between requests

### Consider Privacy

When using user identifiers, consider privacy implications:

* Use internal user IDs rather than exposing personal information
* Avoid including personally identifiable information in user identifiers
* Consider using anonymized identifiers for better privacy protection

### Be Consistent

Use the same user identifier format throughout your application:
```python
