## Benefits of App Attribution

When you properly attribute your app usage, you gain access to:

* **Public App Rankings**: Your app appears in OpenRouter's [public rankings](https://openrouter.ai/rankings) with daily, weekly, and monthly leaderboards
* **Model Apps Tabs**: Your app is featured on individual model pages showing which apps use each model most
* **Detailed Analytics**: Access comprehensive analytics showing your app's model usage over time, token consumption, and usage patterns
* **Professional Visibility**: Showcase your app to the OpenRouter developer community
