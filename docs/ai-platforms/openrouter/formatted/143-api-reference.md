## API Reference

> Comprehensive guide to OpenRouter's API. Learn about request/response schemas, authentication, parameters, and integration with multiple AI model providers.

OpenRouter's request and response schemas are very similar to the OpenAI Chat API, with a few small differences. At a high level, **OpenRouter normalizes the schema across models and providers** so you only need to learn one.
