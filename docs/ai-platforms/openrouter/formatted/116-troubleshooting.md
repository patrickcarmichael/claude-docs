## Troubleshooting

**Video not processing?**

* Verify the model supports video input (check `input_modalities` includes `"video"`)
* If using a video URL, confirm the provider supports video URLs (see Provider-Specific Video URL Support above)
* For Gemini on AI Studio, ensure you're using a YouTube link, not a direct video file URL
* If the video URL isn't working, try using a base64-encoded data URL instead
* Check that the video format is supported
* Verify the video file isn't corrupted

**Large file errors?**

* Compress the video to reduce file size
* Reduce video resolution or frame rate
* Trim the video to a shorter duration
* Check model-specific file size limits
* Consider using a video URL (if supported by the provider) instead of base64 encoding for large files

**Poor analysis results?**

* Ensure video quality is sufficient for the task
* Provide clear, specific prompts about what to analyze
* Consider if the video duration is appropriate for the model
* Check if the video content is clearly visible and well-lit
