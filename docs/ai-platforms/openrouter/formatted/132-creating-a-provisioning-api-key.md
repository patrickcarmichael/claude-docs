## Creating a Provisioning API Key

To use the key management API, you first need to create a Provisioning API key:

1. Go to the [Provisioning API Keys page](https://openrouter.ai/settings/provisioning-keys)
2. Click "Create New Key"
3. Complete the key creation process

Provisioning keys cannot be used to make API calls to OpenRouter's completion endpoints - they are exclusively for key management operations.
