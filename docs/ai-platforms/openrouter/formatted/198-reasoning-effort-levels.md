## Reasoning Effort Levels

The `effort` parameter controls how much computational effort the model puts into reasoning:

| Effort Level | Description                                       |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `minimal`    | Basic reasoning with minimal computational effort |
| `low`        | Light reasoning for simple problems               |
| `medium`     | Balanced reasoning for moderate complexity        |
| `high`       | Deep reasoning for complex problems               |
