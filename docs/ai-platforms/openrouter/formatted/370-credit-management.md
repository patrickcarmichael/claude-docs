## Credit Management

### Shared Credit Pool

Organizations maintain a shared credit pool that offers several advantages:

* **Centralized Billing**: All credits purchased in the organization account can be used by any organization member
* **Simplified Accounting**: Track all AI inference costs in one place
* **Budget Control**: Administrators can manage spending and monitor usage across the entire team

### Admin-Only Credit Management

Only organization administrators can:

* Purchase credits for the organization
* View detailed billing information
* Manage payment methods and invoicing settings

>   **⚠️ Warning**
>
> Regular organization members cannot purchase credits or access billing information. Contact your organization administrator for credit-related requests.

### Transferring Credits from Personal to Organization

If you need to transfer credits from your personal account to your organization account:

1. Email [support@openrouter.ai](mailto:support@openrouter.ai) with your request
2. Include your organization details and the amount you wish to transfer
3. Our support team will process the transfer manually

>   **ℹ️ Info**
>
> Credit transfers from personal to organization accounts require manual processing by our support team and cannot be done automatically through the interface.
