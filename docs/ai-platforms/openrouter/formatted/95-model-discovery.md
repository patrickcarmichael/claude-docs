## Model Discovery

You can find image generation models in several ways:

### On the Models Page

Visit the [Models page](/models) and filter by output modalities to find models capable of image generation. Look for models that list `"image"` in their output modalities.

### In the Chatroom

When using the [Chatroom](/chat), click the **Image** button to automatically filter and select models with image generation capabilities. If no image-capable model is active, you'll be prompted to add one.
