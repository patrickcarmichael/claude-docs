## Caching

Some endpoints/models provide implicit caching of prompts. This keeps repeated prompt data in an in-memory cache in the provider's datacenter, so that the repeated part of the prompt does not need to be re-processed. This can lead to considerable cost savings.

OpenRouter has taken the stance that in-memory caching of prompts is *not* considered "retaining" data, and we therefore allow endpoints/models with implicit caching to be hit when a ZDR routing policy is in effect.
