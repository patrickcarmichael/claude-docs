### Switching Between Personal and Organization Accounts

Once you're part of an organization, you can easily switch between your personal account and organization context:

* Use the **organization switcher** at the top of the web application
* When in organization mode, all actions (API usage, credit purchases, key management) are performed on behalf of the organization
* When in personal mode, you're working with your individual account resources
