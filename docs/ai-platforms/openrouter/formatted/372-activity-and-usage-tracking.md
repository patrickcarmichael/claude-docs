## Activity and Usage Tracking

### Organization-Wide Activity Feed

When viewing your activity feed while in organization context, you'll see:

* **All Member Activity**: Usage data from all organization members appears in the activity feed
* **Metadata Only**: Activity shows model usage, costs, and request metadata
* **Key Filtering**: Activity can be filtered by a specific API key to view usage for that key only

>   **⚠️ Warning**
>
>   **Known Limitation**: The activity feed currently shows all organization member activity when in organization context, not just your individual activity. Usage metadata (model used, cost, timing) is visible to all organization members.

### Usage Analytics

Organizations benefit from comprehensive usage analytics:

* Track spending across all team members
* Monitor model usage patterns
* Identify cost optimization opportunities
* Generate reports for budget planning
