## Model Compatibility

Not all models support every modality. OpenRouter automatically filters available models based on your request content:

* **Vision models**: Required for image processing
* **File-compatible models**: Can process PDFs natively or through our parsing system
* **Audio-capable models**: Required for audio input processing
* **Video-capable models**: Required for video input processing

Use our [Models page](https://openrouter.ai/models) to find models that support your desired input modalities.
