## Zero Completion Insurance

> Learn how OpenRouter protects users from being charged for failed or empty AI responses with zero completion insurance.

OpenRouter provides zero completion insurance to protect users from being charged for failed or empty responses. When a response contains no output tokens and either has a blank finish reason or an error, you will not be charged for the request, even if the underlying provider charges for prompt processing.

>   **📝 Note**
>
> Zero completion insurance is automatically enabled for all accounts and requires no configuration.
