## What is User Tracking?

User tracking enables you to specify an arbitrary string identifier for your end-users in API requests. This optional metadata helps OpenRouter understand your sub-users, leading to several benefits:

1. **Improved Caching**: OpenRouter can make caches sticky to your individual users, improving load-balancing and throughput
2. **Enhanced Reporting**: View detailed analytics and activity feeds broken down by your user IDs
