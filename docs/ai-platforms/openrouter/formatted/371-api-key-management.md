## API Key Management

Organizations provide flexible API key management with role-based permissions:

### Member Permissions

* **Create API Keys**: All organization members can create API keys
* **View Own Keys**: Members can only view and manage API keys they created
* **Use Organization Keys**: Keys created by any organization member can be used by all members
* **Shared Usage**: API usage from any organization key is billed to the organization's credit pool

### Administrator Permissions

* **View All Keys**: Administrators can view all API keys created within the organization
* **Manage All Keys**: Full access to edit, disable, or delete any organization API key
* **Monitor Usage**: Access to detailed usage analytics for all organization keys

<Tip>
  When creating API keys within an organization, consider using descriptive names that indicate the key's purpose or the team member responsible for it.
