## Using Presets

There are three ways to use presets in your API requests.

1. **Direct Model Reference**

You can reference the preset as if it was a model by sending requests to `@preset/preset-slug`
```json
{
  "model": "@preset/email-copywriter",
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Write a marketing email about our new feature"
    }
  ]
}
```
2. **Preset Field**
```json
{
  "model": "openai/gpt-4",
  "preset": "email-copywriter",
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Write a marketing email about our new feature"
    }
  ]
}
```
3. **Combined Model and Preset**
```json
{
  "model": "openai/gpt-4@preset/email-copywriter",
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Write a marketing email about our new feature"
    }
  ]
}
```
