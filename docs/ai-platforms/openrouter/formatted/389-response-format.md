## Response Format

When usage accounting is enabled, the response will include a `usage` object with detailed token information:
```json
{
  "object": "chat.completion.chunk",
  "usage": {
    "completion_tokens": 2,
    "completion_tokens_details": {
      "reasoning_tokens": 0
    },
    "cost": 0.95,
    "cost_details": {
      "upstream_inference_cost": 19
    },
    "prompt_tokens": 194,
    "prompt_tokens_details": {
      "cached_tokens": 0,
      "audio_tokens": 0
    },
    "total_tokens": 196
  }
}
```
`cached_tokens` is the number of tokens that were *read* from the cache. At this point in time, we do not support retrieving the number of tokens that were *written* to the cache.
