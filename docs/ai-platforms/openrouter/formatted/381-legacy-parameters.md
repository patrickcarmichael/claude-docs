## Legacy Parameters

For backward compatibility, OpenRouter still supports the following legacy parameters:

* `include_reasoning: true` - Equivalent to `reasoning: {}`
* `include_reasoning: false` - Equivalent to `reasoning: { exclude: true }`

However, we recommend using the new unified `reasoning` parameter for better control and future compatibility.
