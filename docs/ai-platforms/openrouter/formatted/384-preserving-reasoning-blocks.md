## Preserving Reasoning Blocks

<Note title="Model Support">
  Preserving reasoning with reasoning\_details is currently supported by:

  <ul>
    <li>
      All OpenAI reasoning models (o1 series, o3 series, GPT-5 series)
    </li>

    <li>
      All Anthropic reasoning models (Claude 3.7, Claude 4, and Claude 4.1 series)
    </li>

    <li>
      All xAI reasoning models
    </li>

    <li>
      MiniMax M2
    </li>

    <li>
      Kimi K2 Thinking
    </li>
  </ul>
</Note>

The reasoning\_details functionality works identically across all supported reasoning models. You can easily switch between OpenAI reasoning models (like `openai/gpt-5-mini`) and Anthropic reasoning models (like `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4`) without changing your code structure.

If you want to pass reasoning back in context, you must pass reasoning blocks back to the API. This is useful for maintaining the model's reasoning flow and conversation integrity.

Preserving reasoning blocks is useful specifically for tool calling. When models like Claude invoke tools, it is pausing its construction of a response to await external information. When tool results are returned, the model will continue building that existing response. This necessitates preserving reasoning blocks during tool use, for a couple of reasons:

**Reasoning continuity**: The reasoning blocks capture the model's step-by-step reasoning that led to tool requests. When you post tool results, including the original reasoning ensures the model can continue its reasoning from where it left off.

**Context maintenance**: While tool results appear as user messages in the API structure, they're part of a continuous reasoning flow. Preserving reasoning blocks maintains this conceptual flow across multiple API calls.

<Note title="Important for Reasoning Models">
  When providing reasoning\_details blocks, the entire sequence of consecutive
  reasoning blocks must match the outputs generated by the model during the
  original request; you cannot rearrange or modify the sequence of these blocks.
