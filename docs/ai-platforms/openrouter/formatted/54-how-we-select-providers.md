## How We Select Providers

We use three inputs:

* Tool‑calling accuracy from real traffic across billions of calls
* Real‑time provider preferences (pins/ignores) from users making tool calls
* Benchmarking (internal eval suites, Groq OpenBench running LiveMCPBench, official tau2bench, and similar)

You will be routed only to providers that:

1. Are top‑tier on tool‑calling accuracy
2. Fall within a normal range of tool‑calling propensity
3. Are not frequently ignored or blacklisted by users when tools are provided

In our evaluations and open‑source benchmarks (e.g., tau2‑Bench, LiveMCPBench), Exacto shows materially fewer tool‑calling failures and more reliable tool use.

We will continue working with providers not currently in the Exacto pool to help them improve and be included. Exacto targets tool‑calling specifically and is not a broad statement on overall provider quality.
