## Why Use Exacto?

### Why We Built It

Providers running the same model can differ in accuracy due to implementation details in production inference. OpenRouter sees billions of requests monthly, giving us a unique vantage point to observe these differences and minimize surprises for users. Exacto combines benchmark results with real‑world tool‑calling telemetry to select the best‑performing providers.

### Recommended Use Cases

Exacto is optimized for quality‑sensitive, agentic workflows where tool‑calling accuracy and reliability are critical.
