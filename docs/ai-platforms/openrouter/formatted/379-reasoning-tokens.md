## Reasoning Tokens

> Learn how to use reasoning tokens to enhance AI model outputs. Implement step-by-step reasoning traces for better decision making and transparency.

For models that support it, the OpenRouter API can return **Reasoning Tokens**, also known as thinking tokens. OpenRouter normalizes the different ways of customizing the amount of reasoning tokens that the model will use, providing a unified interface across different providers.

Reasoning tokens provide a transparent look into the reasoning steps taken by a model. Reasoning tokens are considered output tokens and charged accordingly.

Reasoning tokens are included in the response by default if the model decides to output them. Reasoning tokens will appear in the `reasoning` field of each message, unless you decide to exclude them.

<Note title="Some reasoning models do not return their reasoning tokens">
  While most models and providers make reasoning tokens available in the
  response, some (like the OpenAI o-series and Gemini Flash Thinking) do not.
