## Best Practices

* **Clear Prompts**: Provide detailed descriptions for better image quality
* **Model Selection**: Choose models specifically designed for image generation
* **Error Handling**: Check for the `images` field in responses before processing
* **Rate Limits**: Image generation may have different rate limits than text generation
* **Storage**: Consider how you'll handle and store the base64 image data
