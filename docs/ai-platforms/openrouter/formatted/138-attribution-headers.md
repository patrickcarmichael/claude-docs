## Attribution Headers

OpenRouter tracks app attribution through two optional HTTP headers:

### HTTP-Referer

The `HTTP-Referer` header identifies your app's URL and is used as the primary identifier for rankings.

### X-Title

The `X-Title` header sets or modifies your app's display name in rankings and analytics.

<Tip>
  Both headers are optional, but including them enables all attribution features. Apps using localhost URLs must include a title to be tracked.
