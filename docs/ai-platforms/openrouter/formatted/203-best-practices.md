## Best Practices

1. **Choose appropriate effort levels**: Use `high` for complex problems, `low` for simple tasks
2. **Consider token usage**: Reasoning increases token consumption
3. **Use streaming**: For long reasoning chains, streaming provides better user experience
4. **Include context**: Provide sufficient context for the model to reason effectively
