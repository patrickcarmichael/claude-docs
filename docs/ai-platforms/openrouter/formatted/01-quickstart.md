# Quickstart

> Get started with OpenRouter's unified API for hundreds of AI models. Learn how to integrate using OpenAI SDK, direct API calls, or third-party frameworks.

OpenRouter provides a unified API that gives you access to hundreds of AI models through a single endpoint, while automatically handling fallbacks and selecting the most cost-effective options. Get started with just a few lines of code using your preferred SDK or framework.

<Tip>
  Looking for information about free models and rate limits? Please see the [FAQ](/docs/faq#how-are-rate-limits-calculated)
</Tip>

In the examples below, the OpenRouter-specific headers are optional. Setting them allows your app to appear on the OpenRouter leaderboards. For detailed information about app attribution, see our [App Attribution guide](/docs/app-attribution).
