## Repetition Penalty

* Key: `repetition_penalty`

* Optional, **float**, 0.0 to 2.0

* Default: 1.0

* Explainer Video: [Watch](https://youtu.be/LHjGAnLm3DM)

Helps to reduce the repetition of tokens from the input. A higher value makes the model less likely to repeat tokens, but too high a value can make the output less coherent (often with run-on sentences that lack small words). Token penalty scales based on original token's probability.
