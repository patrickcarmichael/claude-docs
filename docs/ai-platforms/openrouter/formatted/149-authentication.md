## Authentication

> Learn how to authenticate with OpenRouter using API keys and Bearer tokens. Complete guide to secure authentication methods and best practices.

You can cover model costs with OpenRouter API keys.

Our API authenticates requests using Bearer tokens. This allows you to use `curl` or the [OpenAI SDK](https://platform.openai.com/docs/frameworks) directly with OpenRouter.

>   **⚠️ Warning**
>
> API keys on OpenRouter are more powerful than keys used directly for model APIs.

  They allow users to set credit limits for apps, and they can be used in [OAuth](/docs/use-cases/oauth-pkce) flows.
