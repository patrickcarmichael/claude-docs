## Best Practices

To achieve optimal performance with OpenRouter:

1. **Maintain Healthy Credit Balance**
   * Set up auto-topup with a higher threshold and amount
   * This helps avoid forced credit checks and reduces the risk of hitting zero balance
   * Recommended minimum balance: \$10-20 to ensure smooth operation

2. **Use Provider Preferences**
   * If you have specific latency requirements (whether time to first token, or time to last), there are [provider routing](/docs/features/provider-routing) features to help you achieve your performance and cost goals.
