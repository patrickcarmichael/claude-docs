## Limits

> Learn about OpenRouter's API rate limits, credit-based quotas, and DDoS protection. Configure and monitor your model usage limits effectively.

<Tip>
  Making additional accounts or API keys will not affect your rate limits, as we
  govern capacity globally. We do however have different rate limits for
  different models, so you can share the load that way if you do run into
  issues.
