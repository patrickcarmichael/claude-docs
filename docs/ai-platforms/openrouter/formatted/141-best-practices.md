## Best Practices

### URL Requirements

* Use your app's primary domain (e.g., `https://myapp.com`)
* Avoid using subdomains unless they represent distinct apps
* For localhost development, always include a title header

### Title Guidelines

* Keep titles concise and descriptive
* Use your app's actual name as users know it
* Avoid generic names like "AI App" or "Chatbot"

### Privacy Considerations

* Only public apps, meaning those that send headers, are included in rankings
* Attribution headers don't expose sensitive information about your requests
