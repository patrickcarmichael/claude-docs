## Why evaluators matter

Unlike supervised fine-tuning where you provide perfect examples, RFT uses evaluators to define what "good" means. This is powerful because:

* **No perfect data required** - Just prompts and a way to score outputs
* **Encourages exploration** - Models learn strategies, not just patterns
* **Noise tolerant** - Even noisy signals can improve model performance
* **Encodes domain expertise** - Complex rules and logic that are hard to demonstrate with examples
