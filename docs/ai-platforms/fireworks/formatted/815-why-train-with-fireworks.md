## Why train with Fireworks

### No infrastructure management

Fireworks provides managed fine-tuning, making it easy for teams to ship fine-tuned models without infra or RL expertise:

* Train frontier models like DeepSeek V3 or Kimi K2, without managing GPUs or distributed compute
* Leverage your existing evaluation infrastructure to get to production in hours, not weeks
* Deploy with one-click on Fireworks when training completes

### Built for enterprises & production agents

Secure, observable, and production-ready from day one:

* Native support for multi-turn agents with tool-calling and complex reasoning
* Built-in observability and tracing for every agent interaction
* Flexible deployment: fully managed, hybrid (remote evaluator), or VPC with data isolation
* Encrypted data in transit and at rest (SOC 2, GDPR-ready)
