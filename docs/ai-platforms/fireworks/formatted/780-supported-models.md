## Supported models

Fireworks supports fine-tuning for most major open source models, including DeepSeek, Qwen, Kimi, and Llama model families, and supports fine-tuning large state-of-the-art models like Kimi K2 0905 and DeepSeek V3.1.

To see all models that support fine-tuning, visit the [Model Library for text models](https://app.fireworks.ai/models?filter=LLM\&tunable=true) or [vision models](https://app.fireworks.ai/models?filter=vision\&tunable=true).
