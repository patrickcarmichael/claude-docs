## Foreword

This tutorial demonstrates how to use the Fireworks AI Python SDK with a few toy examples. First, we will use the LLM class to make a simple request to various models and compare the outputs. Then, we will try to fine-tune a model to learn information it has never seen before.

>   **⚠️ Warning**
>
> This tutorial will cost \$10 to run due to the on-demand model deployments.
