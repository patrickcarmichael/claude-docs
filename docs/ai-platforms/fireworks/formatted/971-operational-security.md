## Operational Security

* **Security Reviews & Testing**: Regular penetration testing validates controls.
* **Incident Response**: A formal incident response plan ensures swift containment, customer notification, and remediation if an issue arises.
* **Employee Access**: Only a minimal subset of Fireworks personnel have access to production systems, and all access is logged and periodically reviewed.
* **Third-Party Risk Management**: Vendors and subprocessors undergo rigorous due diligence and contractual security obligations.
