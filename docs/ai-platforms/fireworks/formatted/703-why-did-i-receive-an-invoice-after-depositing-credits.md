## Why did I receive an invoice after depositing credits?

You'll receive an invoice for any usage that **exceeded your pre-purchased credits**. This process happens automatically, regardless of subscription status.

**Example**: If you deposited `$20` in credits but incurred `$83` in usage, you'll be billed for the `$63` difference at month-end.
