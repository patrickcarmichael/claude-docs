## What is a Reward Function?

A reward function is a mechanism for evaluating the quality of model outputs in reinforcement learning from verifiable reward (RLVR) workflows. Reward functions help:

* Provide numerical scores that can be used to optimize models.
* Offer explanations for why specific scores were assigned.
