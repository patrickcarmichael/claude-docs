## Troubleshooting

### Invalid samlResponse or relayState from identity provider

This error occurs if you are trying to use identity provider (IdP) initiated login. Fireworks currently only supports
service provider (SP) initiated login.

See [Understanding SAML](https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/saml/#understand-sp-initiated-sign-in-flow) for an
in-depth explanation.

### Required String parameter 'RelayState' is not present

See above.
