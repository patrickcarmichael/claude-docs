## Setup

1. **Environment**: Ensure your Python environment has `reward-kit` and its development dependencies installed:
```bash
   # From the root of the repository

   pip install -e ".[dev]"
```
2. **API Key**: The default configuration (`run_math_with_formatting_eval.yaml`) uses a Fireworks AI model (e.g., `accounts/fireworks/models/qwen3-235b-a22b`). Ensure your `FIREWORKS_API_KEY` is set in your environment or a `.env` file.
