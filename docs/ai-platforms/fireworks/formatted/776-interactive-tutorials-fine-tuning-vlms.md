## Interactive Tutorials: Fine-tuning VLMs

For a hands-on, step-by-step walkthrough of VLM fine-tuning, we've created two fine tuning cookbooks that demonstrates the complete process from dataset preparation, model deployment to evaluation.

The cookbooks above cover the following:

* Setting up your environment with Fireworks CLI
* Preparing vision datasets in the correct format
* Launching and monitoring VLM fine-tuning jobs
* Testing your fine-tuned model
* Best practices for VLM fine-tuning
* Running inference on serverless VLMs
* Running evals to show performance gains
