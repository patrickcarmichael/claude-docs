Source: https://docs.fireworks.ai/faq-new/deployment-infrastructure/what-are-the-rate-limits-for-on-demand-deployments


On-demand deployments have GPU quotas that determine your maximum allocation.

For detailed information about on-demand deployment quotas and GPU limits, see our [Rate Limits & Quotas guide](/guides/quotas_usage/rate-limits#gpu-limits-with-on-demand-deployments).

<Tip>
  Need higher GPU allocations? [Contact us](https://fireworks.ai/company/contact-us) to discuss custom solutions for your use case.
