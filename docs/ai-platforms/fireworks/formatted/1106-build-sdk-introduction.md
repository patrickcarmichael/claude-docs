## Build SDK Introduction

Source: https://docs.fireworks.ai/tools-sdks/python-client/sdk-introduction


The [Fireworks Build SDK](https://pypi.org/project/fireworks-ai/) is a client library that allows you to interact with the Fireworks API using Python. It provides a simple and intuitive interface for working with Fireworks primitives like deployments, fine-tuning jobs, and datasets as Python objects.

>   **📝 Note**
>
> The Build SDK is currently in beta and not all functionality may be supported. Please reach out to [dhuang@fireworks.ai](mailto:dhuang@fireworks.ai) to report any issues or feedback.
