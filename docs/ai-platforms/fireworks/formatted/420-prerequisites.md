## Prerequisites

To use the E2B code execution reward function, you need:

1. An E2B API key from [E2B Dashboard](https://e2b.dev/dashboard)
2. The `e2b_code_interpreter` Python package installed: `pip install e2b_code_interpreter`

Note: The code will also work with the `e2b` package, but `e2b_code_interpreter` is recommended as it provides a more stable interface specifically designed for code execution.
