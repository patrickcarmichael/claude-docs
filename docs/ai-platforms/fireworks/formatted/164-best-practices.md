## Best practices

1. **Warm up your deployment**: Run a few requests before benchmarking to ensure models are loaded
2. **Test realistic scenarios**: Use request patterns and payloads similar to your production workload
3. **Gradually increase load**: Start with low concurrency and gradually increase to find your deployment's limits
4. **Monitor for errors**: Track error rates and response codes to identify issues under load
5. **Compare configurations**: Test different deployment shapes, quantization levels, and hardware to optimize cost and performance
