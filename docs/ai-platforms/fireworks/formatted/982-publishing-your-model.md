## Publishing your model

By default, models are private to your account. Publish a model to make it available to other Fireworks users.

**When published:**

* Listed in the public model catalog
* Deployable by anyone with a Fireworks account
* Still hosted and controlled by your account

**Publish a model:**
```bash
firectl update model <MODEL_ID> --public
```
**Unpublish a model:**
```bash
firectl update model <MODEL_ID> --public=false
```
