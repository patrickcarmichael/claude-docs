## Switching between accounts

You can easily switch which Fireworks account your GitHub authentication logs into by changing your primary email address on GitHub before logging in. This allows you to:

* Log into different Fireworks accounts using the same GitHub account
* Switch between personal and work accounts by updating your GitHub primary email
* Maintain separate billing and usage tracking for different email addresses

The authentication will use whatever email is set as primary at the time of login, so you can switch accounts by simply updating your GitHub primary email before authenticating.
