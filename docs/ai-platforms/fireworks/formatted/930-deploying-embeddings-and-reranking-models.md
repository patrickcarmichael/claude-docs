## Deploying embeddings and reranking models

While Qwen3 Embedding 8b and Qwen3 Reranker 8b are available on serverless, you also have the option to deploy them via [on-demand deployments](/guides/ondemand-deployments).

<Tip>
  We recommend passing `--load-targets default=0.4` to ensure proper autoscaling responsiveness for these deployments
