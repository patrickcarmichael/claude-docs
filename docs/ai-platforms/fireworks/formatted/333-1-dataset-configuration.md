## 1. Dataset Configuration

Before evaluation, you need to configure your dataset. This involves setting up YAML files (typically in `conf/dataset/` or an example's `conf/dataset/` directory) to define how raw data is sourced, processed, and formatted (e.g., adding system prompts).

Refer to the [Dataset Configuration Guide](/evaluators/developer_guide/dataset_configuration_guide) for detailed instructions.
