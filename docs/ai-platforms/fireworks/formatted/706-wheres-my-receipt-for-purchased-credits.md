## Where's my receipt for purchased credits?

Receipts for purchased credits are sent via Stripe upon purchase. Check your email for receipts from Stripe (not Fireworks). If you can't find your receipt, contact [billing@fireworks.ai](mailto:billing@fireworks.ai).

> For detailed information about spend limits, tiers, and quotas, see our [Rate Limits & Quotas guide](/guides/quotas_usage/rate-limits).
