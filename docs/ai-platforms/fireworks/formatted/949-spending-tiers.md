## Spending tiers

Your account tier determines the maximum budget you can set:

| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Tier 1    | [Valid payment method](https://fireworks.ai/billing)  | \$50               |
| Tier 2    | Spend or add \$50 in credits                          | \$500              |
| Tier 3    | Spend or add \$500 in credits                         | \$5,000            |
| Tier 4    | Spend or add \$5,000 in credits                       | \$50,000           |

<Tip>
  Add prepaid credits to unlock a higher tier. For example, adding \$100 moves you from Tier 1 to Tier 2. Your new tier activates within minutes.
