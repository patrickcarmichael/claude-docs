## Use with Fireworks Build SDK

llm = LLM(model="llama-v3p1-70b-instruct", deployment_type="auto")

response = llm.chat.completions.create(
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": system_prompt},
        {"role": "user", "content": user_message}
    ]
)
```
By following these optimization techniques, you can significantly improve your application's performance through effective prompt caching while maintaining the quality and functionality of your AI system.

### How it works

Fireworks will automatically find the longest prefix of the request that is
present in the cache and reuse it. The remaining portion of the prompt will be
processed as usual.

The entire prompt is stored in the cache for future reuse. Cached prompts
usually stay in the cache for at least several minutes. Depending on the model,
load level, and deployment configuration, it can be up to several hours. The
oldest prompts are evicted from the cache first.

Prompt caching doesn't alter the result generated by the model. The response you
receive will be identical to what you would get if prompt caching was not used.
Each generation is sampled from the model independently on each request and is not
cached for future usage.
