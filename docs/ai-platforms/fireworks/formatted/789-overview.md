## Overview

Reinforcement fine-tuning uses two categories of parameters to control model training: **training parameters** that govern how the model learns, and **rollout (sampling) parameters** that control how the model generates responses during training.

Most experiments converge well with the default values. Adjust parameters only when you have a clear hypothesis based on your training metrics and reward curves.
