## Switching between accounts

You can easily switch which Fireworks account your LinkedIn authentication logs into by changing your primary email address on LinkedIn before logging in. This allows you to:

* Log into different Fireworks accounts using the same LinkedIn account
* Switch between personal and work accounts by updating your LinkedIn primary email
* Maintain separate billing and usage tracking for different email addresses

The authentication will use whatever email is set as primary at the time of login, so you can switch accounts by simply updating your LinkedIn primary email before authenticating.
