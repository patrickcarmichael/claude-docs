## Serverless model lifecycle

Serverless models are managed by the Fireworks team and may be updated or deprecated as new models are released. We provide **at least 2 weeks advance notice** before removing any model, with longer notice periods for popular models based on usage.

**For production workloads requiring long-term model stability**, we recommend using [on-demand deployments](/guides/ondemand-deployments), which give you full control over model versions and updates.

<Tip>
  Make sure to add a [payment method](https://fireworks.ai/billing) to access [higher rate limits](/guides/quotas_usage/rate-limits) up to 6,000 RPM. Without a payment method, you're limited to 10 RPM.
