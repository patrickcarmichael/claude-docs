## 7. Best Practices

1. **Iterative Development**: Start simple, test thoroughly, and refine your reward function. Use `reward-kit run` and `reward-kit preview` extensively.
2. **Version Control**: Use version control for your reward functions, configurations, and datasets.
3. **Sample Diversity**: Test with a diverse set of samples to ensure robustness.
4. **Documentation**: Document the behavior and assumptions of your reward function.
5. **Error Handling**: Include robust error handling in your reward logic to prevent evaluation failures.
6. **Logging**: Add detailed logging within your reward functions for easier debugging.
