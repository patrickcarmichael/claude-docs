## Grammar Mode

For advanced use cases where JSON isn't sufficient, use [Grammar mode](/structured-responses/structured-output-grammar-based) to constrain outputs using custom BNF grammars. Grammar mode is ideal for:

* **Classification tasks** – Limit output to a predefined list of options
* **Language-specific output** – Force output in specific languages or character sets
* **Custom formats** – Define arbitrary output structures beyond JSON
