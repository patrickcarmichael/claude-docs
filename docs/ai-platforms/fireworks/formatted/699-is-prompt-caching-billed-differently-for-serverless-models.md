## Is prompt caching billed differently for serverless models?

Source: https://docs.fireworks.ai/faq-new/billing-pricing/is-prompt-caching-billed-differently


No, **prompt caching does not affect billing for serverless models**. You are charged the same amount regardless of whether your request benefits from prompt caching or not.
