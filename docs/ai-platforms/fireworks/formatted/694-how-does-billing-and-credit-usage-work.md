## How does billing and credit usage work?

Source: https://docs.fireworks.ai/faq-new/billing-pricing/how-does-billing-and-credit-usage-work


Usage and billing operate through a **tiered system**:

* Each **tier** has a monthly usage limit, regardless of available credits.
* Once you reach your tier's limit, **service will be suspended** even if you have remaining credits.
* **Usage limits** reset at the beginning of each month.
* Pre-purchased credits do not prevent additional charges once the limit is exceeded.

<Tip>
  For detailed information about spend limits, tiers, and how to manage them, see our [Rate Limits & Quotas guide](/guides/quotas_usage/rate-limits#spend-limits).
