## How credits are applied

Fireworks operates with a **postpaid billing** system:

* **Prepaid credits are used first** for all usage
* Once credits are exhausted, you **continue to accrue charges** for additional usage
* **Usage charges** are billed at the end of each month
* **Prepaid credits are instantly applied** to any outstanding balance

**Example**: If you had a `$750` outstanding bill and added `$500` in credits, your bill would reduce to `$250`, with \$0 remaining credits available for new usage.
