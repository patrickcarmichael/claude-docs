## Control plane and data plane

The Fireworks API can be split into a control plane and a data plane.

* The **control plane** consists of APIs used for managing the lifecycle of resources. This
  includes your account, models, and deployments.
* The **data plane** consists of the APIs used for inference and the backend services that power
  them.
