## Monitoring

For dedicated deployments, information about prompt caching is returned in the
response headers. The header `fireworks-prompt-tokens` contains the number of tokens
in the prompt, out of which `fireworks-cached-prompt-tokens` are cached.

Aggregated metrics are also available in the [usage dashboard](https://fireworks.ai/account/usage?type=deployments).
