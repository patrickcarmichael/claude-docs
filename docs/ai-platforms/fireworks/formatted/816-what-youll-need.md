## What you'll need

Before getting started with RFT, make sure you have:

* **A Fireworks account** with some credit for training
* **Prompts/examples** you are interested in evaluating in JSONL format
* **Evaluation logic** to score model outputs (can be simple like exact match or complex like code execution)
