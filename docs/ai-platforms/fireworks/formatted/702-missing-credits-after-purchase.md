## Missing credits after purchase?

If you don't see your credits reflected immediately:

1. Visit your **billing dashboard**
2. Review the **"Credits"** section
3. Check your **current outstanding balance**

**Important**: Credits are always applied to any existing balance before being available for new usage. If you had an outstanding balance, your credits were automatically applied to reduce it.
