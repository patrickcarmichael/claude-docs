## Are there SLAs for serverless?

Source: https://docs.fireworks.ai/faq-new/deployment-infrastructure/is-latency-guaranteed-for-serverless-models


Our multi-tenant serverless offering does not currently come with Service Level Agreements (SLAs) for latency or availability.

If you have specific performance or availability requirements, we recommend:

* **On-demand deployments**: Provides dedicated resources with predictable performance
* **Contact sales**: [Reach out to discuss](https://fireworks.ai/company/contact-us) custom solutions and enterprise options
