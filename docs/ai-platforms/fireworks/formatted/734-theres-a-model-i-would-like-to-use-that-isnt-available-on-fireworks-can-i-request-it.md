Fireworks supports a wide array of custom models and actively takes feature requests for new, popular models to add to the platform.

**To request new models**:

1. **Join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/fireworks-ai)**
2. Let us know which models you’d like to see
3. Provide **use case details**, if possible, to help us prioritize

We regularly evaluate and add new models based on:

* **Community requests**
* **Popular demand**
* **Technical feasibility**
* **Licensing requirements**
