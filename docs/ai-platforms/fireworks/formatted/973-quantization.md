## Quantization

Source: https://docs.fireworks.ai/models/quantization

Reduce model precision to improve performance and lower costs

Quantization reduces the number of bits used to serve a model, improving performance and reducing cost by 30-50%. However, this can change model numerics which may introduce small changes to the output.

<Tip>
  Read our [blog post](https://fireworks.ai/blog/fireworks-quantization) for a detailed treatment of how quantization affects model quality.
