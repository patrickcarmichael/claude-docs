## Direct Preference Optimization

Source: https://docs.fireworks.ai/fine-tuning/dpo-fine-tuning


Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) fine-tunes models by training them on pairs of preferred and non-preferred responses to the same prompt. This teaches the model to generate more desirable outputs while reducing unwanted behaviors.

**Use DPO when:**

* Aligning model outputs with brand voice, tone, or style guidelines
* Reducing hallucinations or incorrect reasoning patterns
* Improving response quality where there's no single "correct" answer
* Teaching models to follow specific formatting or structural preferences
