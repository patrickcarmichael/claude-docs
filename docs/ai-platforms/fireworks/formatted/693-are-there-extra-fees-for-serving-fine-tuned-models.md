## Are there extra fees for serving fine-tuned models?

Source: https://docs.fireworks.ai/faq-new/billing-pricing/are-there-extra-fees-for-serving-fine-tuned-models


No, deploying fine-tuned models to serverless infrastructure is free. Here's what you need to know:

**What's free**:

* Deploying fine-tuned models to serverless infrastructure
* Hosting the models on serverless infrastructure
* Deploying up to 100 fine-tuned models

**What you pay for**:

* **Usage costs** on a per-token basis when the model is actually used
* The **fine-tuning process** itself, if applicable

>   **ℹ️ Info**
>
> Only a limited set of models are supported for serverless hosting of fine-tuned models. Checkout the [Fireworks Model Library](https://app.fireworks.ai/models?filter=LLM\&serverlessWithLoRA=true) to see models with serverless support for fine-tuning.

*Note*: This differs from on-demand deployments, which include hourly hosting costs.
