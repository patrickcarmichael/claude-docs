## Setup

1. **Environment**: Ensure your Python environment is set up with `reward-kit` and its development dependencies installed. If you haven't already, install them from the root of the repository:
```bash
   pip install -e ".[dev]"
```
2. **API Key**: The default configuration uses a Fireworks AI model (`accounts/fireworks/models/deepseek-v3-0324`) for code generation. Make sure your `FIREWORKS_API_KEY` is set in your environment or in a `.env` file in the project root.
