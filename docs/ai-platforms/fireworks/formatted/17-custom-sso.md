## Custom SSO

Source: https://docs.fireworks.ai/accounts/sso

Set up custom Single Sign-On (SSO) authentication for Fireworks AI

Fireworks uses single sign-on (SSO) as the primary mechanism to authenticate with the platform.
By default, Fireworks supports Google SSO.

If you have an enterprise account, Fireworks supports bringing your own identity provider using:

* OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider
* SAML 2.0 provider

>   **ℹ️ Info**
>
> Coordinate with your Fireworks AI representative to enable the integration.
