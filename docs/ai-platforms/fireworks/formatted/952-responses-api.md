## Responses API

Source: https://docs.fireworks.ai/guides/response-api


Fireworks.ai offers a powerful Responses API that allows for more complex and stateful interactions with models. This guide will walk you through the key features and how to use them.

<Warning title="Data Retention Policy">
  The Responses API has a different data retention policy than the chat completions endpoint. See [Data Privacy & security](/guides/security_compliance/data_handling#response-api-data-retention).
