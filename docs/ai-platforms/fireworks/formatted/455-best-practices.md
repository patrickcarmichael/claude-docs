## Best Practices

1. **Be Explicit About Units**: Specify whether units should be considered in the comparison
2. **Consider Fractions vs. Decimals**: Decide if approximate decimal answers are acceptable for fraction problems
3. **Set Appropriate Tolerance**: Use a tolerance appropriate for the problem (e.g., higher for complex calculations)
4. **Look for Final Answers**: Set up extraction patterns to focus on the final answer rather than intermediate steps
5. **Multiple Representations**: Consider all valid forms of an answer (fraction, decimal, scientific notation)
6. **LaTeX Handling**: Take advantage of the LaTeX support for nicely formatted answers
