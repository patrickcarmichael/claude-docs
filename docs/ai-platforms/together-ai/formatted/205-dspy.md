Using DSPy with Together AI

DSPy is a framework for programming language models rather than relying on static prompts. It enables you to build modular AI systems with code instead of hand-crafted prompting, and it offers methods to automatically optimize these systems.

Features

* Programmatic approach to LLM interactions through Python
* Modular components for building complex AI pipelines
* Self-improvement algorithms that optimize prompts and weights
* Support for various applications from simple classifiers to RAG systems and agent loops
