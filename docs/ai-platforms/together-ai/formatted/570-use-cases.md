* Reviewing a piece of code for both security vulnerabilities and stylistic improvements at the same time.
* Analyzing a lengthy document by dividing it into sections and assigning each section to a separate LLM for summarization, then combining the summaries into a comprehensive overview.
* Simultaneously analyzing a text for emotional tone, intent, and potential biases, with each aspect handled by a dedicated LLM.
* Translating a document into multiple languages at the same time by assigning each language to a separate LLM, then aggregating the results for multilingual output.
