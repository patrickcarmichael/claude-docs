## Job Timing

### How long will it take for my job to start?

It depends. Factors that affect waiting time include the number of pending jobs from other customers, the number of jobs currently running, and available hardware. If there are no other pending jobs and there is available hardware, your job should start within a minute of submission. Typically jobs will start within an hour of submission. However, there is no guarantee on waiting time.

### How long will my job take to run?

It depends. Factors that impact your job run time are model size, training data size, and network conditions when downloading/uploading model/training files. You can estimate how long your job will take to complete training by multiplying the number of epochs by the time to complete the first epoch.
