## Troubleshooting Payment Declines

There are many reasons that payments can be declined. If your payment isn't going through, check the following:

* Is there enough money in your account to cover the payment?
* Have you filled in all of the address information when adding the card?
* Is the payment card in date?
* Have you activated the card? (If recently replaced)
* Have you entered the correct CVV number?
* **Have you filled in all of the address information when adding the card?** Ensure the billing address exactly matches what's registered with your card provider, including the zip/post code. Even if your payment provider shows the transaction as approved, address mismatches can still cause declines on our end.
* **Are you using a supported card type?** Together AI only accepts credit or debit cards linked to a bank account. Prepaid cards are not supported and will be declined. Virtual cards are also often blocked by issuing banks for certain types of transactions.
* **Does your card support recurring payments?** Together AI requires payment cards that support recurring payments. Some prepaid cards or cards from certain banks may not support this feature, which can cause payment declines even with valid card information.
* **Are you seeing a \$0 authorization hold from your bank?** This is a normal verification process to confirm your card is active before charging the actual amount. You need to approve this authorization hold in your banking app or with your bank for the real payment to go through.
* **Are you waiting long enough for processing?** Credit purchases can take up to 15 minutes to complete. Avoid re-entering your card details during this processing period, as this may cause multiple credit purchases.
* Is your card frozen/blocked by your bank?
* Does your card have any spending limits that you might have reached?
* Is your bank sending you an additional security prompt that you need to complete?

If you see the error message "We only accept credit or debit cards," this indicates you're trying to use an unsupported payment method. Make sure you're using a regular credit or debit card linked to a bank account, not a prepaid card, virtual card, or alternative payment method.
