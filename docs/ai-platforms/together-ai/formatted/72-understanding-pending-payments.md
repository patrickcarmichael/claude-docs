## Understanding Pending Payments

There are a number of stages to every payment made on the Together AI platform.

First, our payment processor contacts your bank to approve the payment.

When it's approved and the payment has gone through we then generate an invoice which you can access from your account.

Then our payment systems need to update your account balance to reflect the purchase.

Once all of this has happened, your balance updates.

Typically all of this happens within 60 seconds of you confirming the payment. Often instantly. But sometimes there can be a delay in the process, either due to our systems or due to your bank taking longer than expected to confirm the payment.

If this happens, you will see a 'pending' banner on your Together AI dashboard to let you know that we're aware of the transaction, but it's still in progress.

If this is the case, please don't make any further payments. Each further payment will be treated as an individual transaction, so you could end up buying more credit packs than you intended.

### Understanding Credit Types and Account Tiers

**Important:** Having credits in your balance doesn't automatically upgrade your account tier. There are two types of credits:

* **Free credits** - Promotional credits granted to your account

* **Purchased credits** - Credits you've bought with real money

Even if you have free credits showing in your balance, you may still be on the **Limited tier** and unable to access your API key. Build Tier 1 and higher tiers are unlocked only after **\$5 of actual account spend**

If you're seeing tier-related access errors despite having credits, check whether your credits are free credits or purchased credits. You may need to make an actual purchase to upgrade your tier status.
