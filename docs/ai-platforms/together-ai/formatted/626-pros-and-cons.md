## Pros and Cons

Reasoning models excel for tasks where you need:

* High accuracy and dependable decision-making capabilities
* Solutions to complex problems involving multiple variables and ambiguous data
* Can afford higher query latencies
* Have a higher cost/token budget per task

Non-reasoning models are optimal when you need:

* Faster processing speed (lower overall query latency) and lower operational costs
* Execution of clearly defined, straightforward tasks
* Function calling, JSON mode or other well structured tasks
