## Changing Your Email Address

Due to our OAuth authentication system, email addresses cannot be changed directly on existing accounts. However, you can transfer your account to a new email address by following these steps:

1. **Create a new account** using your preferred email address at our sign-up page

2. **Contact our Support team** from your current account email address and provide the new email address

3. **Old account deactivation** - Your original account will be blocked to prevent any confusion

4. **Update integrations** - Make sure to update any API integrations to use your new account's API key

When contacting support, please include your new email address and any relevant account details to help verify your identity.

Once the transfer is complete, you'll be able to access all your previous account features and credits using your new email address.
