## How does Together's Rerank API work?

Together's serverless Rerank API allows you to seamlessly integrate supported rerank models into your enterprise applications. It takes in a `query` and a number of `documents`, and outputs a relevancy score and ordering index for each document. It can also filter its response to the n most relevant documents.

Together's Rerank API is also compatible with Cohere Rerank, making it easy to try out our reranker models on your existing applications.

Key features of Together's Rerank API include:

* Flagship support for [LlamaRank](/docs/together-and-llamarank), Salesforce’s reranker model
* Support for JSON and tabular data
* Long 8K context per document
* Low latency for fast search queries
* Full compatibility with Cohere's Rerank API
