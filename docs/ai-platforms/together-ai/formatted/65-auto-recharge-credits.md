## Auto-Recharge Credits

Together supports the ability to automatically purchase additional credits if your account balance falls below a set threshold. To enable this feature, follow these steps:

1. Log into your account by visiting [api.together.ai/settings/billing](https://api.together.ai/settings/billing).

2. Select "Add Credits".

3. Set the following options:

   * **Auto-recharge amount:** The amount of credits to purchase (default \$25).

   * **Auto-recharge threshold:** The account balance at which auto-recharge is triggered.

Note: If you set a threshold above your current balance, auto-recharge will trigger immediately, purchasing credits in increments of your top-up amount until the threshold is met. This may result in multiple purchases if the gap is larger than the top-up amount.
