## Advanced Tips

### Token Optimization

* Use `/compress` to maintain context while reducing token usage
* Set appropriate session limits based on your Together AI plan
* Monitor usage with `/stats` command

### Model Selection Strategy

* Use **DeepSeek V3** for general coding tasks
* Switch to **Qwen3-Coder** for complex code generation
* Use **Llama 3.3 70B** for faster, cost-effective operations

### Context Window Management

Qwen Code is designed to handle large codebases beyond traditional context limits:

* Automatically chunks and processes large files
* Maintains conversation context across multiple API calls
* Optimizes token usage through intelligent compression
