## Building An AI Data Analyst

Source: https://docs.together.ai/docs/data-analyst-agent

Learn how to use code interpreter to build an AI data analyst with E2B and Together AI.

Giving LLMs the ability to execute code is very powerful – it has many advantages such as:

* Better reasoning
* More complex tasks (e.g., advanced data analysis or mathematics)
* Producing tangible results such as charts
* Immediate testing (and correcting) of the produced output.

In this example, we'll show you how to build an AI data analyst that can read in data and make charts. We'll be using [E2B](https://e2b.dev/docs) for the code interpreter and Together AI for the LLM piece.
