## Together Code Sandbox

Source: https://docs.together.ai/docs/together-code-sandbox

Level-up generative code tooling with fast, secure code sandboxes at scale

Together Code Sandbox offers a fully configurable development environment with fast start-up times, robust snapshotting, and a suite of mature dev tools.

Together Code Sandbox can spin up a sandbox by cloning a template in under 3 seconds. Inside this VM, you can run any code, install any dependencies and even run servers.

Under the hood, the SDK uses the microVM infrastructure of CodeSandbox to spin up sandboxes. It supports:

* Memory snapshot/restore (checkpointing) at any point in time
* Resume/clone VMs from a snapshot in 3 seconds
* VM FS persistence (with git version control)
* Environment customization using Docker & Docker Compose (Dev Containers)
