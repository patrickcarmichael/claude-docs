* **Reinforcement learning (RL) training**: TCI transforms code execution into an interactive RL environment where generated code is run and evaluated in real time, providing reward signals from successes or failures, integrating automated pass/fail tests, and scaling easily across parallel workers—thus creating a powerful feedback loop that refines coding models over many trials.
* **Developing agentic workflows**: TCI allows AI agents to seamlessly write and execute Python code, enabling robust, iterative, and secure computations within a closed-loop system.
