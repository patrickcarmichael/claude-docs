## Parallel Workflow

Source: https://docs.together.ai/docs/parallel-workflows

Execute multiple LLM calls in parallel and aggregate afterwards.

Parallelization takes advantage of tasks that can broken up into discrete independent parts. The user's prompt is passed to multiple LLMs simultaneously. Once all the LLMs respond, their answers are all sent to a final LLM call to be aggregated for the final answer.
