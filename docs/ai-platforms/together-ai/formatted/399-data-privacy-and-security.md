## Data Privacy and Security

### Is my data stored or logged?

Together does not store your input or output by default. Temporary caching may be used for performance unless otherwise configured.

### Will my data be used to train other models?

Data sharing for training other models is opt-in and not enabled by default. You can check or modify this setting in your [account profile](https://api.together.ai/settings/profile) under Privacy & Security. See our [privacy policy](https://www.together.ai/privacy) for more details.

### Can I run inference in my own VPC or on-premise?

Yes. Together supports private networking VPC-based deployments for enterprise customers requiring data residency or regulatory compliance. [Contact us](https://www.together.ai/contact) for more information.
