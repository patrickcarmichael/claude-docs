## What is the Together.ai user key?

Every account has a default API key. You can find and copy this key under Manage Account on the dashboard. For the time being, this first API key cannot be revoked. If it is compromised, it can be regenerated. If this happens, no further work is required on your end, all the Together systems will recognize the regenerated API key as the new default API key.
