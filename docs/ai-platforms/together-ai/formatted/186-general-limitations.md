## General Limitations

Currently, the capabilities of DeepSeek-R1 fall short of DeepSeek-V3 in general purpose tasks such as:

* Function calling
* Multi-turn conversation
* Complex role-playing
* JSON output.

This is due to the fact that long CoT reinforcement learning training was not optimized for these general purpose tasks and thus for these tasks you should use other models.
