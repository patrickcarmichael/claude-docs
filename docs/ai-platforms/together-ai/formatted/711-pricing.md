## Pricing

The self-serve option for running Code Sandbox is priced according to the CodeSandbox SDK plans which follows two main pricing components:

VM credits: Credits serve as the unit of measurement for VM runtime. One credit equates to a specific amount of resources used per hour, depending on the specs of the VM you are using. VM credits follow a pay-as-you-go approach and are priced at \$0.01486 per credit. Learn more about credits here.

VM concurrency: This defines the maximum number of VMs you can run simultaneously with the SDK. As explored below, each CodeSandbox plan has a different VM concurrency limit.

<Tip>
  ### Note

  We use minutes as the smallest unit of measurement for VM credits. E.g.: if a VM runs for 3 minutes and 25 seconds, we bill the equivalent of 4 minutes of VM runtime.
