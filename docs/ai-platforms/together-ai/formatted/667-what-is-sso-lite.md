## What is SSO Lite?

>   **⚠️ Warning**
>
> SSO Lite is only available for Scale and Enterprise accounts. If you would like to upgrade your account to use SSO please contact our [sales team](https://www.together.ai/contact-sales)

SSO Lite enables a secure multi-member collaboration model within a single Together account. With SSO Lite you can:

* Securely connect Together accounts with an existing Identity Provider (IdP). Our currently supported platforms include Google Workspace, Okta, Microsoft Entra, and JumpCloud.
* Onboard and offboard members through your IdP.
* Share access to organizational resources like fine-tuned models, inference analytics, and billing.

>   **📝 Note**
>
> SSO Lite is currently in early access. Fine-grained role-based access and spend controls are on our roadmap and will be added to the SSO Lite experience in the future.
