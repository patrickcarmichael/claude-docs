## Free Trial and Access Requirements

Together AI does not currently offer free trials. Access to the Together platform requires a minimum \$5 credit purchase.

A \$100 negative balance limit is being introduced. Users in Build Tiers 1–4 will continue to be billed at the end of the month for usage up to negative \$100. Accruing a balance below negative \$100 in a given month will require prepayment using credits. Current Build Tier 5 users will retain their existing postpaid limits.
