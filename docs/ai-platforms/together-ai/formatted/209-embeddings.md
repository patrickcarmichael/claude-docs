## Embeddings

Source: https://docs.together.ai/docs/embeddings-overview

Learn how to get an embedding vector for a given text input.

Together's Embeddings API lets you turn some input text (the *input*) into an array of numbers (the *embedding*). The resulting embedding can be compared against other embeddings to determine how closely related the two input strings are.

Embeddings from large datasets can be stored in vector databases for later retrieval or comparison. Common use cases for embeddings are search, classification, and recommendations. They're also used for building Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) applications.
