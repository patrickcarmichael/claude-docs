## Inviting Others to Use Your Account

At the moment Together AI only has User Management features available to our GPU Cluster customers.

We can offer username/password logins to our Scale and Enterprise customers as a way of allowing multiple individuals to work from the same account.

If you're on a Build plan, or don't wish to share your credentials you can allow others to use Together AI services via your account by creating and then sharing additional API keys through your account settings.
