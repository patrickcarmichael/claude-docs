## Deleting Your Account

You can delete your Together AI account and associated data through our self-service process. This process ensures compliance with data protection regulations including GDPR.

### Steps to Delete Your Account

1. Log in to your Together AI account

2. Navigate to your profile settings at [api.together.xyz/settings/profile](https://api.together.xyz/settings/profile)

3. Scroll down to the "Privacy and Security" section

4. Click the "delete your account" link at the bottom of the page

5. Follow the prompts to confirm account deletion

**Important:** Account deletion will remove all your personal data from our systems and unsubscribe you from all mailing lists. This action cannot be undone. Additionally, due to OAuth authentication, you cannot create a new account using the same email address after deletion - you would need to use a different email address to sign up again.

If you experience any issues with the account deletion process, please contact our support team through the platform and we will assist you promptly.
