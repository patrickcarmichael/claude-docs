#### Free Models Available

Together AI offers several free models that you can use without cost:

* **Llama 3.3 70B Instruct Turbo Free** - Free endpoint for this 70B multilingual LLM optimized for dialogue

##### Image Generation:

* **FLUX.1 \[schnell] Free** - Free endpoint for the SOTA open-source image generation model by Black Forest Labs
