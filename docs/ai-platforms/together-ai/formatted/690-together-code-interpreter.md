## Together Code Interpreter

Source: https://docs.together.ai/docs/together-code-interpreter

Execute LLM-generated code seamlessly with a simple API call.

Together Code Interpreter (TCI) enables you to execute Python code in a sandboxed environment.

The Code Interpreter currently only supports Python. We plan to expand the language options in the future.

> ℹ️ MCP Server
>
> TCI is also available as an MCP server through [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/server/@togethercomputer/mcp-server-tci). This makes it easier to add code interpreting abilities to any MCP client like Cursor, Windsurf, or your own chat app.
