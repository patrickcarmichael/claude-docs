## Use cases

* Breaking down a coding problem into subtasks, using an LLM to generate code for each subtask, and making a final LLM call to combine the results into a complete solution.
* Searching for data across multiple sources, using an LLM to identify relevant sources, and synthesizing the findings into a cohesive answer.
* Creating a tutorial by splitting each section into subtasks like writing an introduction, outlining steps, and generating examples. Worker LLMs handle each part, and the orchestrator combines them into a polished final document.
* Dividing a data analysis task into subtasks like cleaning the data, identifying trends, and generating visualizations. Each step is handled by separate worker LLMs, and the orchestrator integrates their findings into a complete analytical report.
