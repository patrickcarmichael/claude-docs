## Key Features & Usage

### Native Terminal Experience

OpenCode provides a responsive, native terminal UI that's fully themeable and integrated into your command-line workflow.

### Plan Mode vs Build Mode

Switch between modes using the **Tab** key:

* **Plan Mode**: Ask OpenCode to create implementation plans without making changes
* **Build Mode**: Let OpenCode directly implement features and make code changes

### File References with Fuzzy Search

Use the `@` key to fuzzy search and reference files in your project:
```
How is authentication handled in @packages/functions/src/api/index.ts
```
