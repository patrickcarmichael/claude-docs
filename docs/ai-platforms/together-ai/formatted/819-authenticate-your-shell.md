## Authenticate your shell

The CLI relies on the `TOGETHER_API_KEY` environment variable being set to your account's API token to authenticate requests. You can find your API token in your [account settings](https://api.together.xyz/settings/api-keys).

Tocreate an environment variable in the current shell, run:
```sh
export TOGETHER_API_KEY=xxxxx
```
You can also add it to your shell's global configuration so all new sessions can access it. Different shells have different semantics for setting global environment variables, so see your preferred shell's documentation to learn more.
