## Preference Fine-Tuning

Source: https://docs.together.ai/docs/preference-fine-tuning

Learn how to use preference fine-tuning on Together Fine-Tuning Platform

Preference fine-tuning allows you to train models using pairs of preferred and non-preferred examples. This approach is more effective than standard fine-tuning when you have paired examples that show which responses your model should generate and which it should avoid.

We use [Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18290) for this type of fine-tuning.

Before proceeding: Review our [How-to: Fine-tuning](/docs/fine-tuning-quickstart) guide for an overview of the fine-tuning process.
