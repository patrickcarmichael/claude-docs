## FAQs

### What does the setup process involve?

To get started, reach out to Customer Support or your Account Executive to let them know you'd like to enable SSO Lite.

Please include the following information with your request:

* Legal company name
* Email domain(s) used by your team (e.g., @company.com)
* Identity Provider (IdP) (e.g., Google Workspace, Okta, etc.)
* Account to use as the initial owner (this should be the account with the most Together usage)

### How long does setup take?

If you have an existing account/contract with Together, we aim to have SSO fully set up within 24–48 working hours of receiving your request. Complex configurations may take longer.

### Why are we moving away from shared username/password enterprise sign on accounts?

Our legacy "enterprise sign-on" required teams to share a single username/password account. This approach has several downsides:

* **Security risk** – shared credentials increase the chance of unauthorized access.
* **No scalability** – no way to onboard/offboard at the individual level.
* **No collaboration** – all activity is tied to one account, making it impossible to eventually share work or manage usage by members.
* **No future features** – we are retiring enterprise sign-on within the next 1–2 months and will not roll out any new improvements to it.

Going forward, we will not be recommending enterprise sign-on as the default path for team collaboration.

### I have a shared username/password enterprise sign on account, why should I migrate?

Enterprise sign-on will be deprecated in the coming months. Migrating now can prevent disruptive and time-consuming manual transitions later when your team has accumulated models, analytics, and billing history that are difficult to re-map.

### Does Together use my IdP's default session timeout?

No, Together sessions will have their own session timeout.
