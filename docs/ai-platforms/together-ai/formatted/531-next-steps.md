## Next Steps

Now that you have nanochat running, you can:

1. **Experiment with different prompts** - Test the model's conversational abilities and domain knowledge
2. **Fine-tune further** - Modify the SFT data or run additional RL training for specific behaviors
3. **Deploy to production** - Extend `chat_web.py` with authentication and persistence layers
4. **Scale the model** - Try the `run1000.sh` script for a larger model with better performance
5. **Integrate with other tools** - Use the inference API to build custom applications

For more details on the nanochat architecture and training process, visit the [nanochat GitHub repository](https://github.com/karpathy/nanochat).
