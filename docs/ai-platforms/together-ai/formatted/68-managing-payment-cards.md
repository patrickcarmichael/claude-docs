## Managing Payment Cards

Together AI allows you to link only one payment card at a time to your account. You can update this card at any time through your [billing settings](https://api.together.ai/settings/billing).

### Updating Your Payment Card

1. In your billing settings, click the "Update Card" button in the **Payment Info** panel
2. Enter your new card details in the popup window
3. Save and complete any verification steps requested by your card provider

You can follow this flow even if you're updating billing information for the same card, for example if you have a new Tax ID. However, **billing addresses must match your card details due to fraud prevention measures** - you cannot update to a different billing address while keeping the same payment card.

Please note that the Tax ID field won't appear until you have entered your address information.

**Note:** If you need to add your organization name, add a different email address to receive invoices, or add a non-standard Tax ID format, contact Support for assistance. These changes cannot be made through the billing settings interface.

### Removing Payment Cards

When you link a card to Together's systems, it enables updates to your account that allow negative balances, with charges on the 3rd of each month. Due to these account changes, you can only update the linked payment card. You cannot delete the card linked to the account without providing replacement details.
