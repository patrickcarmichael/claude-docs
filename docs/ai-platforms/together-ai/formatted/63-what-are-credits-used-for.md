## What are Credits Used For?

Together credits are the unit used to measure and charge for usage of Together AI services on your account. Once purchased, credits can be used immediately for:

* API requests
* Dedicated endpoints
* Fine-tuning jobs
* Evaluation jobs
* All other Together AI services

Note that you need sufficient balance to cover the costs of dedicated endpoint creation or fine-tuning/evaluation job creation.
