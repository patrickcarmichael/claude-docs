## Can I create multiple API keys?

Under [Settings](https://api.together.ai/settings/api-keys) you will find a list of all the API keys associated with the account. Here, you can create a new API key, set an API key name and optionally set an expiration date.

>   **📝 Note**
>
> Note: new API keys will not be available to copy after creation. Make sure to copy the API key and save it in a secure location.
