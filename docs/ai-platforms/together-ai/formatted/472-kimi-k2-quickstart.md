How to get the most out of models like Kimi K2.

Kimi K2 is a state-of-the-art mixture-of-experts (MoE) language model developed by Moonshot AI. It's a 1 trillion total parameter model (32B activated) that is currently the best non-reasoning open source model out there.

It was trained on 15.5 trillion tokens, supports a 256k context window, and excels in agentic tasks, coding, reasoning, and tool use. Even though it's a 1T model, at inference time, the fact that only 32 B parameters are active gives it near‑frontier quality at a fraction of the compute of dense peers.

In this quick guide, we'll go over the main use cases for Kimi K2, how to get started with it, when to use it, and prompting tips for getting the most out of this incredible model.
