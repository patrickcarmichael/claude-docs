## Instructions

1. Log in to [api.together.xyz](https://api.together.xyz/playground) with your username and password
2. Navigate through the different playgrounds we offer using the left sidebar
3. Select a model (either one that we offer, or one you have fine-tuned yourself)
4. Adjust the modifications and parameters (more details below)

### Modifications

From the right side panel you can access **modifications** to control the stop sequence or system prompt. The stop sequence controls when the model will stop outputting more text. The system prompt instructs the model how to behave. There are several default system prompts provided and you can add your own. To edit a system prompt you added, hover over the prompt in the menu and click the pencil icon.

### Parameters

Edit inference parameter settings from the right side panel. For more information on how to set these settings see [inference parameters](/docs/inference-parameters).
