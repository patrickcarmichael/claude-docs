## Conditional Workflow

Source: https://docs.together.ai/docs/conditional-workflows

Adapt to different tasks by conditionally navigating to various LLMs and tools.

A workflow where user input is classified and directed to a specific task (can be a specific LLM, specific custom prompt, different tool calls etc.). This allows you to handle for many different inputs and handle them with the appropriate set of calls.
