## Flux Kontext

Black Forest Labs has released FLUX Kontext with support on Together AI. These models allow you to generate and edit images through in-context image generation.

Unlike existing text-to-image models, FLUX.1 Kontext allows you to prompt with both text and images, and seamlessly extract and modify visual concepts to produce new, coherent renderings.

The Kontext family includes three models optimized for different use cases: Pro for balanced speed and quality, Max for maximum image fidelity, and Dev for development and experimentation.
