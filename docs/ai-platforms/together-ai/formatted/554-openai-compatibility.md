## OpenAI Compatibility

Source: https://docs.together.ai/docs/openai-api-compatibility

Together's API is compatible with OpenAI's libraries, making it easy to try out our open-source models on existing applications.

Together's API endpoints for chat, vision, images, embeddings, speech are fully compatible with OpenAI's API.

If you have an application that uses one of OpenAI's client libraries, you can easily configure it to point to Together's API servers, and start running your existing applications using our open-source models.
