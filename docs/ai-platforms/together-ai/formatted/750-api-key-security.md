## API Key Security

Together does not put any restrictions on what you can do with the API keys assigned to/created by your account.

We recommend that you do not publish your key on any publicly accessible repository or site.

Exercise care when choosing to enter your key on any website or service and only share keys with people that you trust.

Each key generated by your account (and your generated main account key) give you and anybody with those keys full access to your accounts resources, including any available credits, which will top up if you have a recharge mechanism set, and your \$100 negative balance.

If your key is leaked or shared with somebody who uses it beyond the guidelines you set out, Together takes no responsibility for any additional charges or balance due on your account unless our systems are found to be at fault.

If you suspect your API key has been leaked, or want to block an existing key from being used you can rotate your main account key and delete additional keys in your [account settings](https://api.together.ai/settings/api-keys).

### Regenerating Your API Key

If your API key is compromised or you need to change it:

1. Go to your [API Keys settings](https://api.together.xyz/settings/api-keys)
2. Click the triple dot button next to your key
3. Select "Regenerate API key"

This will immediately cancel the existing key and display a new one to use moving forward.
