## Quickstart: Next.Js

Source: https://docs.together.ai/docs/nextjs-chat-quickstart

Build an app that can ask a single question or chat with an LLM using Next.js and Together AI.

In this guide you'll learn how to use Together AI and Next.js to build two common AI features:

* Ask a question and getting a response
* Have a long-running chat with a bot

We'll first build these features using the Together AI SDK directly, then show how to build a chat app using popular frameworks like Vercel AI SDK and Mastra.

[Here's the live demo](https://together-nextjs-chat.vercel.app/), and [here's the source on GitHub](https://github.com/samselikoff/together-nextjs-chat) .

Let's get started!
