## Token Calculation

The tokenization step is part of the fine-tuning process on our API. The exact token count and final price of your job will be available after tokenization completes. You can find this information in:

* Your [jobs dashboard](https://api.together.xyz/jobs)
* Or by running `together fine-tuning retrieve $JOB_ID` in the CLI
