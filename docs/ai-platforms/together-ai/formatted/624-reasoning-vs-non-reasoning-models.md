## Reasoning vs. Non-reasoning Models

Reasoning models are trained very differently from their non-reasoning counterparts, and as a result they serve different purposes. Below we'll compare both types of models, details for reasoning models, pros and cons, applications and example use-cases.

Reasoning models like `DeepSeek-R1` are specifically developed to engage in extended, deep analysis of complex challenges. Their strength lies in strategic thinking, developing comprehensive solutions to intricate problems, and processing large amounts of nuanced information to reach decisions. Their high precision and accuracy make them particularly valuable in specialized fields traditionally requiring human expertise, such as mathematics, scientific research, legal work, healthcare, financial analysis.

Non-reasoning models such as `Llama 3.3 70B` or `DeepSeek-V3` are trained for efficient, direct task execution with faster response times and better cost efficiency.

Your application can leverage both types of models: using DeepSeek-R1 to develop the strategic framework and problem-solving approach, while deploying non-reasoning models to handle specific tasks where swift execution and cost considerations outweigh the need for absolute precision.
