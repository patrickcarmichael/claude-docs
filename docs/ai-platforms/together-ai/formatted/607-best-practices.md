## Best Practices

1. **Structured Data Definition**: Define clear schemas for your expected output, making it easier to validate and process the extracted data.
2. **Model Selection**: Choose the appropriate model based on your use case. Feel free to experiment with [our vision models](/docs/serverless-models#vision-models) to find the best one for you.
3. **Error Handling**: Always implement robust error handling for cases where the OCR might fail or return unexpected results.
4. **Validation**: Implement validation for the extracted data to ensure accuracy and completeness.

By following these patterns and leveraging Together AI's vision models, you can build powerful OCR applications that go beyond simple text extraction to provide structured, actionable data from images.
