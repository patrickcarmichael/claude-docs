## Iterative Workflow

Source: https://docs.together.ai/docs/iterative-workflow

Iteratively call LLMs to optimize task performance.

The iterative workflow ensures task requirements are fully met through iterative refinement. An LLM performs a task, followed by a second LLM evaluating whether the result satisfies all specified criteria. If not, the process repeats with adjustments, continuing until the evaluator confirms all requirements are met.
