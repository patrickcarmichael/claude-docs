## Migration Options

When a model is deprecated on our serverless platform, users have three options:

1. **On-demand Dedicated Endpoint** (if supported):
   * Reserved solely for the user, users choose underlying hardware.
   * Charged on a price per minute basis.
   * Endpoints can be dynamically spun up and down.
2. **Monthly Reserved Dedicated Endpoint**:
   * Reserved solely for the user.
   * Charged on a month-by-month basis.
   * Can be requested via this [form](form).
3. **Migrate to a newer serverless model**:
   * Switch to an updated model on the serverless platform.
