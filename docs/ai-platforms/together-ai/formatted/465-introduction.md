## Introduction

Standard large language models respond to user queries by generating plain text. This is great for many applications like chatbots, but if you want to programmatically access details in the response, plain text is hard to work with.

Some models have the ability to respond with structured JSON instead, making it easy to work with data from the LLM's output directly in your application code.

If you're using a supported model, you can enable structured responses by providing your desired schema details to the `response_format` key of the Chat Completions API.
