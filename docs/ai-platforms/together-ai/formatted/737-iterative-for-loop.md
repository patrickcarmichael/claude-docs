## Iterative (For loop)

A task repeats until a condition is met. For example, generating random numbers until finding a prime number.

Learn more about [Iterative Workflows](/docs/iterative-workflow)

When evaluating which workflow to use for a task consider tradeoffs between task complexity, latency and cost. Workflows with parallel execution capabilities can dramatically reduce perceived latency, especially for tasks involving multiple independent operations like scraping several websites. Iterative workflows are great for optimizing for a given task until a termination condition is met but can be costly.
