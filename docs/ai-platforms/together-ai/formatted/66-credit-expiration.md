## Credit Expiration

No, prepaid balance credits in your Together.ai account do not currently have an expiration date. You can use your credits at any time after purchase.

If any changes to this policy are made in the future, Together.ai will notify customers in advance through official communications.

At Together AI, we understand that everyone has their own circumstances and we want to make sure that none of our customers are ever put in a tricky situation as a result of an unexpected bill from us.

To try and avoid such a situation, we offer usage based billing and credit packs, which are charged at the time of purchase.

**Important:** Credits purchased after an invoice is generated cannot be used to clear previous invoices or past due balances. Past due balances must be paid separately using a valid payment method, regardless of your available credit balance.

If you don't want to use credit packs, or want to make sure you don't spend any more than you buy in credits you can set a balance limit in your accounts [billing settings](https://api.together.ai/settings/billing). Build Tiers 1-4 have a fixed \$100 limit. Build Tier 5, Scale and Enterprise limits can be higher:

**Important payment method requirements:** When purchasing credit packs or setting up billing, Together.ai only accepts credit or debit cards that are directly tied to a bank account. Pre-paid cards of any kind are not supported by the payment system. If you experience issues with card authorization or declined payments, verify that you're using a standard credit or debit card rather than a pre-paid card.

If you're experiencing access issues with a positive balance, check whether your credits are free credits or purchased credits and verify your account tier in your billing settings.
