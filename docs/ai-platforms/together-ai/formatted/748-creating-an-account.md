## Creating an Account

Creating an account is a simple process, just head to our [homepage](https://www.together.ai/) and click the **Get Started** button in the top right.

You will then be taken to our sign in page, where you can choose to sign in using Google or Github.

Once you've selected your login provider, you will be prompted to log in using your username/email and password. Then, you'll be taken straight to your [together.ai](http://together.ai/) dashboard!

[together.ai](http://together.ai/) accounts use OAuth (Open Authorisation) for authentication instead of a traditional username/password system. This not only helps keep your account more secure, but means you have one less password to remember!

**Important:** Once you create your account using one of these OAuth providers (Google or GitHub), you must continue using the same provider for all future logins. If you try to sign in with a different provider than the one you originally used, you'll receive an error message stating "This email is already linked to another sign-in method." Make sure to remember which provider you used when first creating your account.

**Note:** LinkedIn authentication was previously available but has been discontinued. If you previously signed up using LinkedIn, you can now access your account by signing in with Google or GitHub using the same email address.
