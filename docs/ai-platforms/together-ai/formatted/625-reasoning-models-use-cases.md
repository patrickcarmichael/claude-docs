## Reasoning models use-cases

* **Analyzing and assessing AI model outputs**\
  Reasoning models excel at evaluating responses from other systems, particularly in data validation scenarios. This becomes especially valuable in critical fields like law, where these models can apply contextual understanding rather than just following rigid validation rules.

* **Code analysis and improvement**\
  Reasoning models are great at conducting thorough code reviews and suggesting improvements across large codebases. Their ability to process extensive code makes them particularly valuable for comprehensive review processes.

* **Strategic planning and task delegation**\
  These models shine in creating detailed, multi-stage plans and determining the most suitable AI model for each phase based on specific requirements like processing speed or analytical depth needed for the task.

* **Complex document analysis and pattern recognition**\
  The models excel at processing and analyzing extensive, unstructured documents such as contract agreements, legal reports, and healthcare documentation. They're particularly good at identifying connections between different documents and making connections.

* **Precision information extraction**\
  When dealing with large volumes of unstructured data, these models excel at pinpointing and extracting exactly the relevant information needed to answer specific queries, effectively filtering out noise in search and retrieval processes. This makes them great to use in RAG or LLM augmented internet search use-cases.

* **Handling unclear instructions**\
  These models are particularly skilled at working with incomplete or ambiguous information. They can effectively interpret user intent and will proactively seek clarification rather than making assumptions when faced with information gaps.
