## General Limitations of Kimi K2

We've outlined various use cases for when to use Kimi K2, but it also has a few situations where it currently isn't the best. The main ones are for latency specific applications like real-time voice agents, it's not the best solution currently due to its speed.

Similarly, if you wanted a quick summary for a long PDF, even though it can handle a good amount of context (256k tokens), its speed is a bit prohibitive if you want to show text quickly to your user as it can get even slower when it is given a lot of context. However, if you're summarizing PDFs async for example or in another scenario where latency isn't a concern, this could be a good model to try.
