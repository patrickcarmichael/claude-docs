## Accepted Payment Methods

Together AI accepts all major credit and debit cards on networks including Visa, Mastercard, and American Express. Prepaid cards are not supported.

In some territories, there is a legal requirement for banks to request authorization for every transaction, regardless of whether you have set up recurring billing. In these territories, we send an authorization link to your account's registered email. Please monitor your inbox at the start of the month to approve any outstanding balance payments to avoid service interruption.
