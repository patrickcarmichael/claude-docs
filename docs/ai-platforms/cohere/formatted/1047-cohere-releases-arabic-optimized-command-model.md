## Cohere Releases Arabic-Optimized Command Model!

> Release announcement for the Command R7B Arabic model

Cohere is thrilled to announce the release of Command R7B Arabic (`c4ai-command-r7b-12-2024`). This is an open weights release of an advanced, 8-billion parameter custom model optimized for the Arabic language (MSA dialect), in addition to English. As with Cohere's other command models, this one comes with context length of 128,000 tokens; it excels at a number of critical enterprise tasks -- instruction following, length control, [retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/retrieval-augmented-generation-rag), minimizing code-switching -- and it demonstrates excellent general purpose knowledge and understanding of the Arabic language and culture.
