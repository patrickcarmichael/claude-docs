## Conclusion

In this tutorial, you learned about:

* How to rerank lexical/semantic search results
* How to rerank semi-structured data
* How to rerank tabular data
* How to perform multilingual reranking

We have now seen two critical components of a powerful search system - [semantic search](/v2/docs/semantic-search-with-cohere), or dense retrieval (Part 4) and reranking (Part 5). These building blocks are essential for implementing RAG solutions.

In Part 6, you will learn how to [implement RAG](/v2/docs/rag-with-cohere).
