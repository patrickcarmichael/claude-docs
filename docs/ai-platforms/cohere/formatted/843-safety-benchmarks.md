## Safety Benchmarks

The safety of our Command R and Command R+ models has been evaluated on the BOLD (Biases in Open-ended Language Generation) dataset (Dhamala et al, 2021), which contains nearly 24,000 prompts testing for biases based on profession, gender, race, religion, and political ideology.

Overall, both models show a lack of bias, with generations that are very rarely toxic. That said, there remain some differences in bias between the two, as measured by their respective sentiment and regard for "Gender" and "Religion" categories. Command R+, the more powerful model, tends to display slightly less bias than Command R.

Below, we report differences in privileged vs. minoritised groups for gender, race, and religion.
