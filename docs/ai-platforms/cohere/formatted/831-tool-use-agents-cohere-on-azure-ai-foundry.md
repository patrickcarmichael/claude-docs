Tool use enhances retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) capabilities by enabling applications to both answer questions and automate tasks.

Tools provide a broader access to external systems compared to traditional RAG. This approach leverages LLMs' inherent ability to reason and make decisions. By incorporating tools, developers can create agent-like applications that interact with external systems through both read and write operations.

In this chapter, we'll explore how to build an agentic application by building an agent that can answer questions and automate tasks, enabled by a number of tools.
