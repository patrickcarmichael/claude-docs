## Why Private Deployment?

With private deployments, you maintain full control over your infrastructure while leveraging Cohere's state-of-the-art language models.

This enables you to deploy LLMs within your secure network, whether through your chosen cloud provider or your own environment. The data never leaves your environment, and the model can be fully network-isolated.

Here are some of the benefits of private deployments:

* **Data security**: On-prem deployments allow you to keep your data secure and compliant with data protection regulations. A VPC offers similar yet somewhat less rigorous protection.
* **Model customization**: Fine-tuning in a private environment allows enteprises to maintain strict control over their data, avoiding the risk of sensitive or proprietary data leaking.
* **Infrastructure needs**: Public cloud is fast and easily scalable in general. But when the necessary hardware is not available in a specific region, on-prem can provide a faster solution.
