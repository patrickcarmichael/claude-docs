## Request Specification

To make a request to any model, you must pass in the `Authorization` Header and the request must be made through a `POST` request.

The content of `Authorization` should be in the shape of `BEARER [API_KEY]`. All request bodies are sent through JSON.

Model names are found within the dashboard, and details about endpoints are available within the documentation.
