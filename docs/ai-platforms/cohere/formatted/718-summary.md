## Summary

In this tutorial, we learned about:

* How to set up tools in an agentic RAG system
* How to run an agentic RAG workflow
* How to automatically route queries to the most relevant data sources

However, so far we have only seen rather simple queries. In practice, we may run into a complex query that needs to simplified, optimized, or split (etc.) before we can perform the retrieval.

In Part 2, we'll learn how to build an agentic RAG system that can expand user queries into parallel queries.
