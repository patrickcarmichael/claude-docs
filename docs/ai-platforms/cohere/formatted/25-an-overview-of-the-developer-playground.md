## An Overview of the Developer Playground

> The Cohere Playground is a powerful visual interface for testing Cohere's generation and embedding language models without coding.

The [Cohere Playground](https://dashboard.cohere.com/playground) is a visual interface supporting two models:

* [Chat](https://docs.cohere.com/reference/chat)
* [Embed](https://docs.cohere.com/reference/embed)

It's a great way to test our models for specific use cases without writing code; when you're ready to start building, simply click `View Code` to get the underlying logic to add to your application.
