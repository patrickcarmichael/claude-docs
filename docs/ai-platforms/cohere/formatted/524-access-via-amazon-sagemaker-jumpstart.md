## Access Via Amazon SageMaker Jumpstart

Cohere's models are also available on Amazon SageMaker Jumpstart, which makes it easy to access the models with just a few clicks.

To access Cohere's models on SageMaker Jumpstart, follow these steps:

* In the AWS Console, go to Amazon SageMaker and click `Studio`.
* Then, click `Open Studio`. If you don't see this option, you first need to create a user profile.
* This will bring you to the SageMaker Studio page. Look for `Prebuilt and automated solutions` and select `JumpStart`.
* A list of models will appear. To look for Cohere models, type "cohere" in the search bar.
* Select any Cohere model and you will find details about the model and links to further resources.
* You can try out the model by going to the `Notebooks` tab, where you can launch the notebook in JupyterLab.

If you have any questions about this process, reach out to [support@cohere.com](mailto:support@cohere.com).
