## Summary

In this tutorial, we learned about:

* How to create a function to execute Python code
* How to set up a tool to interact with tabular data
* How to run the agent

By implementing these techniques, we've expanded our agentic RAG system to handle structured data in the form of tables.

While this tutorial demonstrated how to work with tabular data using pandas and Python, the agentic RAG approach can be applied to other forms of structured data as well. This means we can build agents that can translate natural language queries into various types of data analysis tasks.

In Part 6, we'll learn how to do structured query generation for SQL databases.
