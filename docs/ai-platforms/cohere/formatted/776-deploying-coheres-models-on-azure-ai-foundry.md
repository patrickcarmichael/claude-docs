## Deploying Cohere's Models on Azure AI Foundry.

To deploy Cohere's models on Azure AI Foundry, follow the steps described in [Azure AI Foundry  documentation here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/how-to/deploy-models-serverless?tabs=azure-ai-studio).

In summary, you will need to:

1. Set up AI Foundry Hub and a project
2. Find your model and model ID in the model catalog
3. Subscribe your project to the model offering
4. Deploy the model to a serverless API endpoint

Models that are offered by Cohere are billed through the Azure Marketplace. For such models, you're required to subscribe your project to the particular model offering.
