## Summary

In this tutorial, we learned about:

* How multi-step tool calling works
* How multi-step, parallel tool calling works
* How multi-step tool calling enables an agent to self-correct, and hence, be more flexible

However, up until now, we have only worked with purely unstructured data, the type of data we typically encounter in a standard RAG system.

In the coming chapters, we'll add another complexity to the agentic RAG system – working with semi-structured and structured data. This adds another dimension to the agent's flexibility, which is dealing with a more diverse set of data sources.

In Part 4, we'll learn how to build an agent that can perform faceted queries over semi-structured data.
