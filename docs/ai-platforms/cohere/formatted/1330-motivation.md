## Motivation

Tabular data reasoning continues to be an exciting application of Agents, particularly in the financial domain, where multiple reasoning steps may be needed to identify the right answer. For example, a financial analyst working with financial statements may be interested in computing various financial ratios with natural language queries.

Some examples may include:

* ROE (Return on Equity) = Net Income / Shareholder's Equity
* Net Profit Margin = Net Income / Revenue
* Asset Turnover = Revenue / Average Total Assets
* Financial Leverage = Average Total Assets / Shareholder's Equity

Having an Agent which is able to correctly compute these and other ratios would be a great help for any analyst in the field of Finance.
