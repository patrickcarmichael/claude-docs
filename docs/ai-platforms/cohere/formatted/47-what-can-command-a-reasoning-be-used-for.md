## What Can Command A Reasoning Be Used For?

Command A is excellent for:

* **Agentic Use Cases**: Taking autonomous actions and interacting with the environment to solve problems.
* **Tool Use**: Able to leverage a variety of tools, such as search engines and APIs.
* **Multilingual**: Able to reason over multilingual inputs, providing support to user queries in 23 different languages.

There's more to be said about token budgets, enabling and disabling the `thinking` operation, etc., which can be found in our dedicated [Reasoning guide](/docs/reasoning).
