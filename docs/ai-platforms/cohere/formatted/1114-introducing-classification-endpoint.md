## Introducing Classification Endpoint

> Classify text with Cohere's new classification endpoint, powered by generation models, offering few-shot learning.

Classification is now available via our classification endpoint. This endpoint is currently powered by our generation models (`small` and `medium`) and supports few-shot classification. We will be deprecating support for Choose Best by May 18th. To learn more about classification at Cohere check out the docs [here](/classify-reference).
