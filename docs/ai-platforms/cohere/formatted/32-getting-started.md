    For learning, we recommend our [LLM University](https://cohere.com/llmu) hub resources, which have been prepared by Cohere experts. These include a number of very high-quality, step-by-step guides to help you start building quickly.

    For building, we recommend checking out our [Github Notebooks](https://github.com/cohere-ai/notebooks), as well as the [Get Started](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/the-cohere-platform) and [Cookbooks](https://docs.cohere.com/page/cookbooks) sections in our documentation.

  <Accordion title="What are some best practices and techniques for prompt engineering, specifically when incorporating documents into a chat model's response?">
    For general recommendations on prompt engineering check the following resources:

    * [Prompt Engineering Basics](https://cohere.com/llmu/prompt-engineering-basics) Guide
    * Tips on [Crafting Effective Prompts](https://docs.cohere.com/v1/docs/crafting-effective-prompts)
    * Techniques of [Advanced Prompt Engineering](https://docs.cohere.com/v1/docs/advanced-prompt-engineering-techniques).

    For the most reliable results when working with external document sources, we recommend using a technique called Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). You can learn about it here:
