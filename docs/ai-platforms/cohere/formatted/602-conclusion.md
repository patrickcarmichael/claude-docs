## Conclusion

In this tutorial, you learned about:

* How to get started with a basic text generation
* How to improve outputs with prompt engineering
* How to control outputs using parameter changes
* How to generate structured outputs
* How to stream text generation outputs

However, we have only done all this using direct text generations. As its name implies, the Chat endpoint can also support building chatbots, which require features to support multi-turn conversations and maintain the conversation state.

In the [next tutorial](/v2/docs/building-a-chatbot-with-cohere), you'll learn how to build chatbots with the Chat endpoint.
