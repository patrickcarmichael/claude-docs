## Working with Cohere Toolkit

The toolkit is powerful and flexible. There's a lot you can do with it, including adding your own [model deployment](https://github.com/cohere-ai/cohere-toolkit?tab=readme-ov-file#how-to-add-your-own-model-deployment), calling the toolkit's backend [over the API](https://github.com/cohere-ai/cohere-toolkit?tab=readme-ov-file#how-to-call-the-backend-as-an-api), adding a [connector](https://github.com/cohere-ai/cohere-toolkit?tab=readme-ov-file#how-to-add-a-connector-to-the-toolkit), and much else besides.
