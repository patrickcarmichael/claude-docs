## Cloud AI services

These managed services enable enterprises to access Cohere’s models on cloud AI services. In this scenario, Cohere’s models are hosted on the cloud provider’s infrastructure. Cohere is cloud-agnostic, meaning you can deploy our models through any cloud provider.

### AWS

Developers can access a range of Cohere’s language models in a private environment via Amazon’s AWS Cloud platform. Cohere’s models are supported on two Amazon services: **Amazon Bedrock** and **Amazon SageMaker**.

#### Amazon Bedrock

Amazon Bedrock is a fully managed service where foundational models from Cohere are made available through a single, serverless API. [Read about Bedrock here](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock).

#### Amazon SageMaker

Amazon SageMaker is a service that allows customers to prepare data and build, train, and deploy machine learning (ML) models for any use case with fully managed infrastructure, tools, and workflows. [Read about SageMaker here.](https://aws.amazon.com/pm/sagemaker/)

Cohere offers a comprehensive suite of generative and embedding models through SageMaker on a range of hardware options, many of which support finetuning for deeper customization and performance.

### Azure AI Foundry

Azure AI Foundry is a platform that is designed for developers to build generative AI applications on an enterprise-grade platform. Developers can explore a wide range of models, services, and capabilities to build AI applications that meet their specific goals.

### OCI Generative AI Service

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Generative AI is a fully managed service that enables you to use Cohere's [generative](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/generative-ai/generate-models.htm) and [embedding models](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/generative-ai/embed-models.htm) through an API.
