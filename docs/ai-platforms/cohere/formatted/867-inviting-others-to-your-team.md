## Inviting others to your Team

If you sign up with Cohere without being invited to a Team, you automatically become the “Owner” of a Team. To invite others to your team, navigate to the Cohere Dashboard, then click on the “Team” page in the sidebar.

### If your teammates do not have existing Cohere accounts

Clicking “+ Invite Teammates” will open a modal where you can send email invites and specify the role that best suits your teammates.

### If your teammates have existing Cohere accounts

Users that already have a Cohere account and are not part of your team cannot be invited to join via the dashboard, but we can migrate them over.

Please reach out to us at [support@cohere.com](mailto:support@cohere.com), letting us know the email address associated with your teammate's account and the email address associated with your Cohere account. We can help from there.
