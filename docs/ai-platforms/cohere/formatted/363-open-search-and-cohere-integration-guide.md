[OpenSearch](https://opensearch.org/platform/search/vector-database.html) is an open-source, distributed search and analytics engine platform that allows users to search, analyze, and visualize large volumes of data in real time. When it comes to text search, OpenSearch is well-known for powering keyword-based (also called lexical) search methods. OpenSearch supports Vector Search and integrates with Cohere through [3rd-Party ML Connectors](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/ml-commons-plugin/remote-models/connectors/) as well as Amazon Bedrock.
