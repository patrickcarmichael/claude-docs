## Track Incidents

Navigate to our <a href="https://status.cohere.ai" target="_blank">status page</a> which features information including a summary status indicator, component statuses, unresolved incidents, status history, and any upcoming or in-progress scheduled maintenance. We recommend subscribing for updates with an email or phone number to receive notifications whenever Cohere creates, updates or resolves an incident.
