## Apply Cohere's AI with Connectors!

One of the most exciting applications of generative AI is known as ["retrieval augmented generation"](/docs/retrieval-augmented-generation-rag) (RAG). This refers to the practice of *grounding* the outputs of a large language model (LLM) by offering it resources -- like your internal technical documentation, chat logs, etc. -- from which to draw as it formulates its replies.

Cohere has made it much easier to utilize RAG in bespoke applications via [Connectors](/docs/overview-rag-connectors). As the name implies, Connectors allow you to *connect* Cohere's generative AI platform up to whatever resources you'd like it to ground on, facilitating the creation of a wide variety of applications -- customer service chatbots, internal tutors, or whatever else you want to build.

Our docs cover how to [create and deploy connectors](/v1/docs/creating-and-deploying-a-connector), [how to manage your connectors ](/docs/managing-your-connector), [how to handle authentication](/docs/connector-authentication), and [more](/docs/connector-faqs)!
