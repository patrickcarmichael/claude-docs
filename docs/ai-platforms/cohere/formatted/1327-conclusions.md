## Conclusions

In this notebook, we've built a QA bot that answers user questions based on technical documentation. We've learnt:

1. How to embed the technical documentation into a vector database using Cohere embeddings and `llama_index`
2. How to build a custom retriever that leverages Cohere's `rerank`
3. How to evaluate model performance against a predetermined set of golden QA pairs
