## Best Practices:

1. Regularly check our documentation for updates on announcements regarding the status of models.
2. Test applications with newer models well before the shutdown date of your current model.
3. Update any production code to use an active model as soon as possible.
4. Contact [support@cohere.ai](mailto:support@cohere.ai) if you need any assistance with migration or have any questions.
