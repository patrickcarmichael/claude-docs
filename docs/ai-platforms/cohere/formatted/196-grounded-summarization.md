## Grounded summarization

Another approach to summarization is using [retrieval-augmented generation](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/retrieval-augmented-generation-rag) (RAG). Here, you can instead pass the document as a chunk of documents to the Chat endpoint call.

This approach allows you to take advantage of the citations generated by the endpoint, which means you can get a grounded summary of the document. Each grounded summary includes fine-grained citations linking to the source documents, making the response easily verifiable and building trust with the user.

Here is a chunked version of the document. (we don’t cover the chunking process here, but if you’d like to learn more, see this cookbook on [chunking strategies](https://github.com/cohere-ai/cohere-developer-experience/blob/main/notebooks/guides/Chunking_strategies.ipynb).)
```python PYTHON
document_chunked = [
    {
        "data": {
            "text": "Equipment rental in North America is predicted to “normalize” going into 2024, according to Josh Nickell, vice president of equipment rental for the American Rental Association (ARA)."
        }
    },
    {
        "data": {
            "text": "“Rental is going back to ‘normal,’ but normal means that strategy matters again - geography matters, fleet mix matters, customer type matters,” Nickell said. “In late 2020 to 2022, you just showed up with equipment and you made money."
        }
    },
    {
        "data": {
            "text": "“Everybody was breaking records, from the national rental chains to the smallest rental companies; everybody was having record years, and everybody was raising prices. The conversation was, ‘How much are you up?’ And now, the conversation is changing to ‘What’s my market like?’”"
        }
    },
]
```
It also helps to create a custom system message to prime the model about the task—that it will receive a series of text fragments from a document presented in chronological order.
```python PYTHON
system_message = """## Task and Context

You will receive a series of text fragments from a document that are presented in chronological order. As the assistant, you must generate responses to user's requests based on the information given in the fragments. Ensure that your responses are accurate and truthful, and that you reference your sources where appropriate to answer the queries, regardless of their complexity."""
```
Other than the custom system message, the only change to the Chat endpoint call is passing the document parameter containing the list of document chunks.

Aside from displaying the actual summary, we can display the citations as as well. The citations are a list of specific passages in the response that cite from the documents that the model receives.

<CodeBlocks>
```python PYTHON
  message = f"Summarize this text in one sentence."

  response = co.chat(
      model="command-a-03-2025",
      documents=document_chunked,
      messages=[
          {"role": "system", "content": system_message},
          {"role": "user", "content": message},
      ],
  )

  print(response.message.content[0].text)

  if response.message.citations:
      print("\nCITATIONS:")
      for citation in response.message.citations:
          print(
              f"Start: {citation.start} | End: {citation.end} | Text: '{citation.text}'",
              end="",
          )
          if citation.sources:
              for source in citation.sources:
                  print(f"| {source.id}")
```
```bash cURL

Josh Nickell, vice president of the American Rental Association, predicts that equipment rental in North America will "normalize" in 2024, requiring companies to focus on strategy, geography, fleet mix, and customer type.
