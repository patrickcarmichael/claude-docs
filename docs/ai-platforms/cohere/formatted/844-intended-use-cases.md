## Intended Use Cases

Command R models are trained for sophisticated text generation—which can include natural text, summarization, code, and markdown—as well as to support complex [Retrieval Augmented Generation](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/retrieval-augmented-generation-rag) (RAG) and [tool-use](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/tool-use) tasks.

Command R models support 23 languages, including 10 languages that are key to global business (English, French, Spanish, Italian, German, Portuguese, Japanese, Korean, Chinese, Arabic). While it has strong performance on these ten languages, the other 13 are lower-resource and less rigorously evaluated.
