## The `tokenize` and `detokenize` API endpoints

Cohere offers the [tokenize](/reference/tokenize) and [detokenize](/reference/detokenize) API endpoints for converting between text and tokens for the specified model. The hosted tokenizer saves users from needing to download their own tokenizer, but this may result in higher latency from a network call.
