## Usage Policy

> Developers must outline and get approval for their use case to access the Cohere API, understanding the models and limitations. They should refer to model cards for detailed information and document potential harms of their application. Certain use cases, such as violence, hate speech, fraud, and privacy violations, are strictly prohibited.

Our Usage Policy applies to all Cohere products and services, including Cohere models, software, applications, and application programming interface (collectively *“Cohere Services”*).

The Usage Policy sets out universal requirements that apply to all users of the Cohere Services, and specific additional requirements that apply to users who create customer applications that integrate Cohere Services (each, a *“Customer Application”*).

We may update this Usage Policy from time to time by posting an updated version on our website.

If we learn that you have violated this Usage Policy or are otherwise misusing or abusing Cohere Services, we are entitled to restrict, suspend, or terminate your access to the Cohere Services. If you become aware of a violation of this Usage Policy, including by any Outputs, please notify us immediately at [safety@cohere.com](mailto:safety@cohere.com). If you are using the Cohere Services in our SaaS Platform, you can also report issues by using the thumbs down button on an Output.  “Outputs” means any information, text, image, audio or video content artificially created by Cohere Services.
