## Objective

In this notebook we explore how to setup a [Cohere Agent](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/multi-step-tool-use) to answer questions over tables in Apple's SEC10K 2020 form. [Financial CSV Agent](https://docs.cohere.com/page/csv-agent) already showed how to use Langchain to ask questions about your data. This notebook will demonstrate how you can build the same agent using Cohere's native API with Langchain Python tool. We will also explore how to make your agent more resilient to errors.
