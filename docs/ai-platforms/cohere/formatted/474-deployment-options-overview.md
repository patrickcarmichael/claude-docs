## Deployment Options - Overview

> This page provides an overview of the available options for deploying Cohere's models.

The most common way to access Cohere’s large language models (LLMs) is through the Cohere platform, which is fully managed by Cohere and accessible through an API.

But that’s not the only way to access Cohere’s models. In an enterprise setting, organizations might require more control over where and how the models are hosted.

Specifically, Cohere offers four types of deployment options.

1. **Cohere Platform**
2. **Cloud AI Services**
3. **Private Deployments - Cloud**
4. **Private Deployments - On-Premises**
