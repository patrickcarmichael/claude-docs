## Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

> Guide on using Cohere's Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) capabilities such as document grounding and citations.

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a method for generating text using additional information fetched from an external data source, which can greatly increase the accuracy of the response. When used in conjunction with [Command](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/models#command) family of models, the [Chat API](https://docs.cohere.com/reference/chat) makes it easy to generate text that is grounded on supplementary documents, thus minimizing hallucinations.
