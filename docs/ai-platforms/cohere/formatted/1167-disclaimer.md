## Disclaimer

One of the challenges in building a RAG system is that it has many moving pieces: vector database, type of embedding model, use of reranker, number of retrieved documents, chunking strategy, and more. These components can make debugging and evaluating RAG systems difficult. Since this notebook focuses on the concept of agentic RAG, it will simplify other parts of the RAG system. For example, we will only retrieve top 1 document to demonstrate what happens when retrieved document does not contain the answer needed.
