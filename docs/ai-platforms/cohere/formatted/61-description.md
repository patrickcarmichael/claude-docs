## Description

<Info title="Note">
  For most use cases we recommend our latest model [Command A](/docs/command-a) instead.
</Info>

Command R+ is a large language model, optimized for conversational interaction and long-context tasks. It aims at being extremely performant, enabling companies to move beyond proof of concept and into production.

We recommend using Command R+ for workflows that lean on complex RAG functionality and [multi-step tool use (agents)](/docs/multi-hop-tool-use). Command R, on the other hand, is great for simpler [retrieval augmented generation](/docs/retrieval-augmented-generation-rag) (RAG) and [single-step tool use](/docs/tool-use) tasks, as well as applications where price is a major consideration.

For information on toxicity, safety, and using this model responsibly check out our [Command model card](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/responsible-use).
