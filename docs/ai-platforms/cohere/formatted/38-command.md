## Command

Command is Cohere's default generation model that takes a user instruction (or command) and generates text following the instruction. Our Command models also have conversational capabilities, meaning they are well-suited for chat applications, and Command A Vision can interact with [image inputs](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/image-inputs).

| Model Name                    | Status                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Modality     | Context Length | Maximum Output Tokens | Endpoints               |
