MongoDB Atlas Vector Search is a fully managed vector search platform from MongoDB. It can be used with Cohere's Embed and Rerank models to easily build semantic search or retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems with your data from MongoDB.

[This guide](https://www.mongodb.com/developer/products/atlas/how-use-cohere-embeddings-rerank-modules-mongodb-atlas/) walks through how to integrate Cohere models with MongoDB Atlas Vector Search.
