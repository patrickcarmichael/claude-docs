## Semantic search - Cohere on Azure AI Foundry

> A guide for performing text semantic search with Cohere's Embed models on Azure AI Foundry (API v2).

[Open in GitHub](https://github.com/cohere-ai/cohere-developer-experience/blob/main/notebooks/guides/cohere-on-azure/v2/azure-ai-sem-search.ipynb)

In this tutorial, we'll explore semantic search using Cohere's Embed modelon Azure AI Foundry.

Semantic search enables search systems to capture the meaning and context of search queries, going beyond simple keyword matching to find relevant results based on semantic similarity.

With the Embed model, you can do this across languages. This is particularly powerful for multilingual applications where the same meaning can be expressed in different languages.

In this tutorial, we'll cover:

* Setting up the Cohere client
* Embedding text data
* Building a search index
* Performing semantic search queries

We'll use Cohere's Embed model deployed on Azure to demonstrate these capabilities and help you understand how to effectively implement semantic search in your applications.
