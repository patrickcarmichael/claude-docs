## Cohere on the Microsoft Azure Platform

> This page describes how to work with Cohere models on Microsoft Azure.

In an effort to make our language-model capabilities more widely available, we've partnered with a few major platforms to create hosted versions of our offerings.

In this article, you learn how to use [Azure AI Foundry](https://ai.azure.com/) to deploy both the Cohere Command models and the Cohere Embed models on Microsoft's Azure cloud computing platform. You can read more about Azure AI Foundry in its documentation[here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/what-is-azure-ai-foundry).

The following models are available through Azure AI Foundry with pay-as-you-go, token-based billing:

* Command A
* Embed v4
* Embed v3 - English
* Embed v3 - Multilingual
* Cohere Rerank V3.5
* Cohere Rerank V3 (English)
* Cohere Rerank V3 (multilingual)
