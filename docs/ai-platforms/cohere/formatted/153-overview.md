## Overview

Tool use is a technique which allows developers to connect Cohere’s Command family models to external tools like search engines, APIs, functions, databases, etc.

This opens up a richer set of behaviors by leveraging tools to access external data sources, taking actions through APIs, interacting with a vector database, querying a search engine, etc., and is particularly valuable for enterprise developers, since a lot of enterprise data lives in external sources.

The Chat endpoint comes with built-in tool use capabilities such as function calling, multi-step reasoning, and citation generation.
