## Unintended and Prohibited Use Cases

We do not recommend using the Command R models on their own for decisions that could have a significant impact on individuals, including those related to access to financial services, employment, and housing.

Cohere’s [Usage Guidelines](https://cohere.com/responsibility) and customer agreements contain details about prohibited use cases, like social scoring, inciting violence or harm, and misinformation or other political manipulation.
