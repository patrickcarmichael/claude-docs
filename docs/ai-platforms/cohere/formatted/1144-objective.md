## Objective

In this notebook we introduce a simple approach to address the issue described above. We propose to use *augmented memory objects*, which we define as compact and interpretable pieces of information based on the reasoning chain and the generation.

Below, we show that, with augmented memory objects, the Agent is more aware of the information that emerged in the conversation, and, in turn, this makes the Agent behaviour more robust and effective.
