## Chat Capabilities

Command R7B Arabic can be operated in two modes, "conversational" and "instruct" mode:

* *Conversational mode* conditions the model on interactive behaviour, meaning it is expected to reply in a conversational fashion, provide introductory statements and follow-up questions, and use Markdown as well as LaTeX where appropriate. This mode is optimized for interactive experiences, such as chatbots, where the model engages in dialogue.
* *Instruct mode* conditions the model to provide concise yet comprehensive responses, and to not use Markdown or LaTeX by default. This mode is designed for non-interactive, task-focused use cases such as extracting information, summarizing text, translation, and categorization.

<aside>
  Note: Command R7B Arabic is delivered without a system preamble by default, though we encourage you to experiment with the conversational and instruct mode preambles. More information can be [found in our docs](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/command-r7b-hf).
