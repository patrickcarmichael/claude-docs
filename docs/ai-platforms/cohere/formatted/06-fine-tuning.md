## Fine-Tuning

To [create a fine-tuned model](/docs/fine-tuning), simply upload a dataset and hold on while we train a custom model and then deploy it for you. Fine-tuning can be done with [generative models](/docs/generate-fine-tuning), [multi-label classification models](/docs/classify-fine-tuning), [rerank models](/docs/rerank-fine-tuning), and [chat models](/docs/chat-fine-tuning).
