## Multi-step tool use now default in Chat API

Tool use is a technique which allows developers to connect Cohere's Command family of models to external tools like search engines, APIs, functions, databases, etc. It comes in two variants, single-step and [multi-step](/docs/multi-step-tool-use), both of which are available through Cohere's Chat API.

As of today, tool use will now be multi-step by default. Here are some resources to help you get started:

* Check out our [multi-step tool use guide](/docs/multi-step-tool-use).
* Experiment with multi-step tool use with [this notebook](https://github.com/cohere-ai/cohere-developer-experience/blob/main/notebooks/agents/Tool_Use.ipynb).
