## Command R: Retrieval-Augmented Generation at Scale

> Command R: Retrieval Augmented Generation at scale.

Today, we are introducing Command R, a new LLM aimed at large-scale production workloads. Command R targets the emerging “scalable” category of models that balance high efficiency with strong accuracy, enabling companies to move beyond proof of concept, and into production.

Command R is a generative model optimized for long context tasks such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and using external APIs and tools. It is designed to work in concert with our industry-leading Embed and Rerank models to provide best-in-class integration for RAG applications and excel at enterprise use cases. As a model built for companies to implement at scale, Command R boasts:

* Strong accuracy on RAG and Tool Use
* Low latency, and high throughput
* Longer 128k context and lower pricing
* Strong capabilities across 10 key languages
* Model weights available on HuggingFace for research and evaluation
