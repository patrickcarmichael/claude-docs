## What can These Models Be Used For?

In this section, we'll provide some high-level context on Cohere's offerings, and what the strengths of each are.

* The Command family of models includes [Command A](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/command-a), [Command R7B](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/command-r7b), [Command A Translate](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/command-a-translate), [Command A Reasoning](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/command-a-reasoning), [Command A Vision](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/command-a-vision), [Command R+](/docs/command-r-plus), [Command R](/docs/command-r), and [Command](https://cohere.com/models/command?_gl=1*15hfaqm*_ga*MTAxNTg1NTM1MS4xNjk1MjMwODQw*_ga_CRGS116RZS*MTcxNzYwMzYxMy4zNTEuMS4xNzE3NjAzNjUxLjIyLjAuMA..). Together, they are the text-generation LLMs powering tool-using agents, [retrieval augmented generation](/docs/retrieval-augmented-generation-rag) (RAG), translation, copywriting, and similar use cases. They work through the [Chat](/reference/chat) endpoint, which can be used with or without RAG.
* [Rerank](https://cohere.com/blog/rerank/?_gl=1*1t6ls4x*_ga*MTAxNTg1NTM1MS4xNjk1MjMwODQw*_ga_CRGS116RZS*MTcxNzYwMzYxMy4zNTEuMS4xNzE3NjAzNjUxLjIyLjAuMA..) is the fastest way to inject the intelligence of a language model into an existing search system. It can be accessed via the [Rerank](/reference/rerank-1) endpoint.
* [Embed](https://cohere.com/models/embed?_gl=1*1t6ls4x*_ga*MTAxNTg1NTM1MS4xNjk1MjMwODQw*_ga_CRGS116RZS*MTcxNzYwMzYxMy4zNTEuMS4xNzE3NjAzNjUxLjIyLjAuMA..) improves the accuracy of search, classification, clustering, and RAG results. It powers the [Embed](/reference/embed) endpoint.
* The [Aya](https://cohere.com/research/aya) family of models are aimed at expanding the number of languages covered by generative AI. Aya Expanse covers 23 languages, and Aya Vision is fully multimodal, allowing you to pass in images and text and get a single coherent response. Both are available on the [Chat](/reference/chat) endpoint.
