## Cohere Models on Amazon Bedrock

> This document provides a guide for using Cohere's models on Amazon Bedrock.

<Note title="Note">
  The code examples in this section use the Cohere v1 API. The v2 API is not yet supported for cloud deployments and will be coming soon.
</Note>

In an effort to make our language-model capabilities more widely available, we've partnered with a few major platforms to create hosted versions of our offerings.

Here, you'll learn how to use Amazon Bedrock to deploy both the Cohere Command and the Cohere Embed models on the AWS cloud computing platform. The following models are available on Bedrock:

* Command R
* Command R+
* Command Light
* Command
* Embed - English
* Embed - Multilingual

Note that the code snippets below are in Python, but you can find the equivalent code for other languages (if they're supported) [here](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/cohere-works-everywhere)
