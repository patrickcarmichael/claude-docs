## Learn More

The rest of the "Text Generation" section of our documentation walks you through how to work with Cohere's models. Check out ["Using the Chat API"](/docs/chat-api) to get set up and understand what a response looks like, or reading the [streaming guide](/docs/streaming) to figure out how to integrate generative AI into streaming applications.

You might also benefit from reading the [retrieval-augmented generation](/docs/retrieval-augmented-generation-rag), [tool-use](/docs/tool-use), and [agent-building](/docs/multi-step-tool-use) guides.
