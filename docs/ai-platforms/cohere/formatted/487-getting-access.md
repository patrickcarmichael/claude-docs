## Getting Access

When you [sign up for private deployment](https://cohere.com/contact-sales), you will receive two key pieces of information:

1. A license key for authenticating and pulling model containers
2. A list of artifacts (docker containers) that you can pull using the license key

You can then use the license to pull and run the images, as described in the [provisioning guide](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/single-container-on-private-clouds).
