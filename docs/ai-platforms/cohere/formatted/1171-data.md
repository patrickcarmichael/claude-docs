        "body": """Traffic infraction - A person operating a bicycle upon a roadway or highway shall be subject to the provisions of this chapter relating to traffic infractions.
        1. Stop for people in crosswalks. Every intersection is a crosswalk - It’s the law. Drivers must stop for pedestrians at intersections, whether it’s an unmarked or marked crosswalk, and bicyclists in crosswalks are considered pedestrians. Also, it is illegal to pass another vehicle stopped for someone at a crosswalk. In Washington, the leading action motorists take that results in them hitting someone is a failure to yield to pedestrians.
        2. Put the phone down. Hand-held cell phone use and texting is prohibited for all Washington drivers and may result in a $136 fine for first offense, $235 on the second distracted-driving citation.
        3. Helmets are required for all bicyclists according to the state and municipal laws. If you are in a group required to wear a helmet but do not wear it you can be fined $48. # If you are the parent or legal guardian of a child under 17 and knowingly allow them to ride without a helmet, you can be fined $136.
