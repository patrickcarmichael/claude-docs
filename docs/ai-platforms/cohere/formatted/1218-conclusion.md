## Conclusion

As you can see, the RAG pipeline can be used as a tool for a Cohere ReAct agent. This allows the agent to access the RAG pipeline for document retrieval and generation, as well as a Python interpreter for postprocessing mathematical operations to improve accuracy. This setup can be used to improve the accuracy of grounded answers to questions about documents that contain both tables and text.
