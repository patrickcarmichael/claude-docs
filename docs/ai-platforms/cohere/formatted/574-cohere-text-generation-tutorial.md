Command is Cohere’s flagship LLM model family. Command models generate a response based on a user message or prompt. It is trained to follow user commands and to be instantly useful in practical business applications, like summarization, copywriting, extraction, and question-answering.

[Command A](/docs/command-a) and [Command R7B](/docs/command-r7b) are the most recent models in the Command family. They are the market-leading models that balance high efficiency with strong accuracy to enable enterprises to move from proof of concept into production-grade AI.

You'll use Chat, the Cohere endpoint for accessing the Command models.

In this tutorial, you'll learn about:

* Basic text generation
* Prompt engineering
* Parameters for controlling output
* Structured output generation
* Streamed output

You'll learn these by building an onboarding assistant for new hires.
