## Overview

As Cohere launches safer and more capable models, we will regularly retire old models. Applications relying on Cohere's models may need occasional updates to keep working. Impacted customers will always be notified via email and in our documentation along with blog posts.
This page lists all API deprecations, along with recommended replacements.

Cohere uses the following terms to describe the lifecycle of our models:

* **Active:** The model and endpoint are fully supported and recommended for use.
* **Legacy:** The model and endpoints will no longer receive updates and may be deprecated in the future.
* **Deprecated:** The model and endpoints are no longer available to new customers but remain available to existing users until retirement. (An existing user is defined as anyone who has used the model or endpoint within 90 days of the deprecation announcement.) A shutdown date will be assigned at that time.
* **Shutdown:** The model and endpoint are no longer available for users. Requests to shutdown models and endpoints will fail.
