## Description

<Info title="Note">
  For most use cases we recommend our latest model [Command A](/docs/command-a) instead.
</Info>

Command R is a large language model optimized for conversational interaction and long context tasks. It targets the “scalable” category of models that balance high performance with strong accuracy, enabling companies to move beyond proof of concept and into production.

Command R boasts high precision on [retrieval augmented generation](/docs/retrieval-augmented-generation-rag) (RAG) and tool use tasks, low latency and high throughput, a long 128,000-token context length, and strong capabilities across 10 key languages.

For information on toxicity, safety, and using this model responsibly check out our [Command model card](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/responsible-use).
