## Build an Onboarding Assistant with Cohere!

> This page describes how to build an onboarding assistant with Cohere's large language models.

Welcome to our hands-on introduction to Cohere! This section is split over seven different tutorials, each focusing on one use case leveraging our Chat, Embed, and Rerank endpoints:

* Part 1: Installation and Setup (the document you're reading now)
* [Part 2: Text Generation](/v2/docs/text-generation-tutorial)
* [Part 3: Chatbots](/v2/docs/building-a-chatbot-with-cohere)
* [Part 4: Semantic Search](/v2/docs/semantic-search-with-cohere)
* [Part 5: Reranking](/v2/docs/reranking-with-cohere)
* [Part 6: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)](/v2/docs/rag-with-cohere)
* [Part 7: Agents with Tool Use](/v2/docs/building-an-agent-with-cohere)

Your learning is structured around building an onboarding assistant that helps new hires at Co1t, a fictitious company. The assistant can help write introductions, answer user questions about the company, search for information from e-mails, and create meeting appointments.

We recommend that you follow the parts sequentially. However, feel free to skip to specific parts if you want (apart from Part 1, which is a pre-requisite) because each part also works as a standalone tutorial.
