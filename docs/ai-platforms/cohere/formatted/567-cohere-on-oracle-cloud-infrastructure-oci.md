## Cohere on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)

> This page describes how to work with Cohere models on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)

In an effort to make our language-model capabilities more widely available, we've partnered with a few major platforms to create hosted versions of our offerings.

Here, you'll learn how to use Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) to deploy both the Cohere Command and the Cohere Embed models on the AWS cloud computing platform. The following models are available on OCI:

* Command R+
* Command R
* Embed English v3
* Embed English v3 light
* Embed Multilingual v3
* Embed Multilingual v3 light
* Cohere Rerank 3.5

We also support fine-tuning for Command R (`command-r-04-2024` and `command-r-08-2024`) on OCI.

For the most updated list of available models, see the [OCI documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/generative-ai/pretrained-models.htm).
