## Expanded Fine-tuning Functionality

Cohere's ready-to-use LLMs, such as Command, are very good at producing responses to natural language prompts. However, there are many cases in which getting the best model performance requires performing an additional round of training on custom user data. This is process known as fine-tuning, and we've dramatically revamped our [fine-tuning documentation](/docs/fine-tuning).

The new docs are organized according to the major endpoints, and we support fine-tuning for [Generate](/docs/generate-fine-tuning), [Classify](/docs/classify-fine-tuning), [Rerank](/docs/rerank-fine-tuning), and [Chat](/docs/chat-fine-tuning).

But wait, there's more: many developers work with generative AI through popular cloud-compute platforms like Amazon Web Services (AWS), and we support [fine-tuning on AWS Bedrock](/docs/fine-tuning-cohere-models-on-amazon-bedrock). We also support fine-tuning with Sagemaker, and the relevant documentation will be published in the coming weeks.
