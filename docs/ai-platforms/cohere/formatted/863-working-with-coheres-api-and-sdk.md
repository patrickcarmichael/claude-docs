## Working with Cohere's API and SDK

> Cohere's NLP platform provides customizable large language models and tools for developers to build AI applications.

The Cohere platform allows you to leverage the power of [large language models](https://docs.cohere.com/v1/docs/the-cohere-platform#large-language-models-llms) (LLMs) with just a few lines of code and an [API key](https://dashboard.cohere.com/api-keys?_gl=1*14v2pj5*_gcl_au*NTczMTgyMTIzLjE3MzQ1NTY2OTA.*_ga*MTAxNTg1NTM1MS4xNjk1MjMwODQw*_ga_CRGS116RZS*MTczNjI3NzU2NS4xOS4xLjE3MzYyODExMTkuNDkuMC4w).

Our [Command](https://docs.cohere.com/v1/docs/command-r7b), [Embed](https://docs.cohere.com/v1/docs/cohere-embed), [Rerank](https://docs.cohere.com/v1/docs/rerank), and [Aya](https://docs.cohere.com/v1/docs/aya) models excel at a variety of applications, from the relatively simple ([semantic search](https://docs.cohere.com/v1/docs/semantic-search-embed), and [content generation](https://docs.cohere.com/v1/docs/introduction-to-text-generation-at-cohere)) to the more advanced ([retrieval augmented generation](https://docs.cohere.com/v1/docs/retrieval-augmented-generation-rag) and [agents](https://docs.cohere.com/v1/docs/multi-step-tool-use)). If you have a more specialized use case and custom data, you can also [train a custom model](https://docs.cohere.com/v1/docs/fine-tuning) to get better performance.

Check out [our documentation](https://docs.cohere.com/v1/docs/the-cohere-platform) if you're ready to start building, and you might want to check out our [API pricing](https://docs.cohere.com/v1/docs/rate-limits).
