## Trial Usage and Production Usage

Cohere makes a distinction between "trial" and "production" usage of an API key.

With respect to pricing, the key thing to understand is that trial API key usage is free, [but limited](/docs/rate-limits). Developers wanting to test different applications or build proofs of concept can use all of Cohere's models and APIs can do so with a trial key by simply signing up for a Cohere account [here](https://dashboard.cohere.com/welcome/register).
