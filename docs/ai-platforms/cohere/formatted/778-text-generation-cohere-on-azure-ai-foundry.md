In this tutorial, we'll explore text generation using Cohere's Command model on Azure AI Foundry.

Text generation is a fundamental capability that enables LLMs to generate text for various applications, such as providing detailed responses to questions, helping with writing and editing tasks, creating conversational responses, and assisting with code generation and documentation.

In this tutorial, we'll cover:

* Setting up the Cohere client
* Basic text generation
* Other typical use cases
* Building a chatbot

We'll use Cohere's Command model deployed on Azure to demonstrate these capabilities and help you understand how to effectively use text generation in your applications.
