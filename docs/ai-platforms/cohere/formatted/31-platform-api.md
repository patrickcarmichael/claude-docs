## Platform & API

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How can I monitor and manage my API usage limits, and what steps can I take if I need higher limits or encounter issues with my current limits?">
    We offer two kinds of API keys: trial keys (with a variety of attendant limitations), and production keys (which have no such limitations). You can learn about them in [this section](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/rate-limits) of our documentation.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How can I access Cohere API for personal projects and prototyping?">
    We make a distinction between “trial” and “production” usage of an API key.

    Trial API key usage is free, [but limited](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/rate-limits). You can test different applications or build proofs of concept using all of Cohere’s models and APIs with a trial key by simply signing up for a Cohere account [here](https://dashboard.cohere.com/welcome/register).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What are the rate limits for different Cohere API endpoints and plan types, and are there any differences in response times?">
    Please refer to [API Keys and Rate Limits section](https://docs.cohere.com/v1/docs/rate-limits) of our documentation.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is there a way to provide feedback, ask questions, or report issues directly to the Cohere team or community?">
    You can contact our support team at [support@cohere.com](mailto:support@cohere.com) and get help and share your feedback with our team and developer community via the [Cohere Discord server](https://discord.gg/co-mmunity).
