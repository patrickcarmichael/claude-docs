## Private deployments

### Cloud (VPC)

Private deployments (cloud) allow enterprises to deploy the Cohere stack privately on cloud platforms. With AWS, Cohere’s models can be deployed in an enterprise’s AWS Cloud environment via their own VPC (EC2, EKS). Compared to managed cloud services, VPC deployments provide tighter control and compliance. No egress is another common reason for going with VPCs. Overall, the VPC option has a higher management burden but offers more flexibility.

### On-premises

Private deployments on-premises (on-prem) allow enterprises to deploy the Cohere stack privately on their own compute. This includes air-gapped environments where systems are physically isolated from unsecured networks, providing maximum security for sensitive workloads.
