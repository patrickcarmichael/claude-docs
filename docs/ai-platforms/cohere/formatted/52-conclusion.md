## Conclusion

Command A Translate is great for one-shot translations but can also be embedded into more complicated workflows, such as translating long texts. Check out [our cookbook](https://docs.cohere.com/page/command-a-translate) for an example implementation.

Cohere enterprise clients may be interested in Deep Translation, our agentic approach to reaching the highest-quality translations. You can reach out to our sales team for more information.
