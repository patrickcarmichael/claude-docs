## Conclusions \[#sec\_conclusion]

In this notebook we showed how Agents can be used to solve a real-world use case, in which the goal is to create API requests based on the user's query. We did it by providing the Agent with a deterministic tool to extract relevant alphanumeric strings in the query, and matching them to the right parameter name. In parallel, the Agent can leverage the semantic understanding of the query provided by the LLM powering it.
