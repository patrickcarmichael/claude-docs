## Using Cohere models via the OpenAI SDK

> The document serves as a guide for Cohere's Compatibility API, which allows developers to seamlessly use Cohere's models using OpenAI's SDK.

The Compatibility API allows developers to use Cohere’s models through OpenAI’s SDK.

It makes it easy to switch existing OpenAI-based applications to use Cohere’s models while still maintaining the use of OpenAI SDK — no big refactors needed.

The supported libraries are:

* TypeScript / JavaScript
* Python
* .NET
* Java (beta)
* Go (beta)

This is a quickstart guide to help you get started with the Compatibility API.
