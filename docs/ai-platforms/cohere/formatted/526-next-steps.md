## Next Steps

With your selected configuration and Product ARN available, you now have everything you need to integrate with Cohere’s model offerings on SageMaker.

Cohere recommends your next step be to find the appropriate notebook in [Cohere's list of Amazon SageMaker notebooks](https://github.com/cohere-ai/cohere-aws/tree/main/notebooks/sagemaker), and follow the instructions there, or provide the link to Cohere’s SageMaker notebooks to your development team to implement. The notebooks are thorough, developer-centric guides that will enable your team to begin leveraging Cohere’s endpoints in production for live inference.

If you have further questions about subscribing or configuring Cohere’s product offerings on Amazon SageMaker, please contact our team at [support+aws@cohere.com](mailto:support+aws@cohere.com).
