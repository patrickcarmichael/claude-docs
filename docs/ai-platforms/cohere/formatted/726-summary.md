## Summary

In this tutorial, we learned about:

* How query expansion works in an agentic RAG system
* How query expansion works over multiple data sources
* How query expansion works in multi-turn conversations

Having said that, we may encounter even more complex queries than what we've seen so far. In particular, some queries require sequential reasoning where the retrieval needs to happen over multiple steps.

In Part 3, we'll learn how the agentic RAG system can perform sequential reasoning.
