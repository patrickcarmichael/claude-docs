## Conclusion

In this tutorial, you learned about:

* How to get started with RAG
* How to generate search queries
* How to perform retrieval with Embed
* How to perform reranking with Rerank
* How to generate response and citations

RAG is great for building applications that can *answer questions* by grounding the response in external documents. But you can unlock the ability to not just answer questions, but also *automate tasks*. This can be done using a technique called tool use.

In Part 7, you will learn how to leverage [tool use](/v2/docs/building-an-agent-with-cohere) to automate tasks and workflows.
