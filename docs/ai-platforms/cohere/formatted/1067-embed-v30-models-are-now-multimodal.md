## Embed v3.0 Models are now Multimodal

> Launch of multimodal embeddings for our Embed models, plus some code to help get started.

Today we’re announcing updates to our embed-v3.0 family of models. These models now have the ability to process images into embeddings. There is no change to existing text capabilities which means there is no need to re-embed texts you have already processed with our `embed-v3.0` models.

In the rest of these release notes, we’ll provide more details about technical enhancements, new features, and new pricing.
