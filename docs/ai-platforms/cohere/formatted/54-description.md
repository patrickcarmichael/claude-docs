## Description

Command A Vision is Cohere's first multimodal model capable of understanding and interpreting visual data alongside text. With a 128K context length and support for up to 20 images per request, Command Vision excels at enterprise use cases including document analysis, chart interpretation, optical character recognition (OCR), and processing images featuring multiple languages. The model maintains the same API interface as other Command models, making it easy to integrate vision capabilities into existing applications.
