## We've published additional docs!

Cohere's models and functionality are always improving, and we've recently dropped the following guides to help you make full use of our offering:

* [Predictable outputs](/docs/predictable-outputs) - Information about the `seed` parameter has been added, giving you more control over the predictability of the text generated by Cohere models.
* [Using Cohere SDKs with private cloud models](/docs/cohere-works-everywhere) - To maximize convenience in building on and switching between Cohere-supported environments, our SDKs have been developed to allow seamless support of whichever cloud backend you choose. This guide walks you through when you can use Python, Typescript, Go, and Java on Amazon Bedrock, Amazon SageMaker, Azure, and OCI, what features and parameters are supported, etc.
