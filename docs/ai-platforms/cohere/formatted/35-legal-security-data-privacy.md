## Legal, Security, Data Privacy

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Is my data private and secure when using Cohere platform, or is it accessible to others?">
    When you’re using Cohere models via our Platform, we segment your data using logical segmentation. When using Cohere models via a private or cloud deployment from one of our partners, your data is not shared with Cohere.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Could you provide more specific information about your GDPR compliance practices and policies, including any relevant documentation, so that I can forward the details to our legal team for review?">
    We support our enterprise customers’ privacy and data security compliance needs by offering multiple deployment options so customers can control access to data and personal information under their control. Seamlessly complete your privacy and security compliance reviews by visiting Cohere’s [Trust Center](https://cohere-inc.secureframetrust.com/) where you can request a copy of our SOC 2 Type II Report, and review our privacy documentation and other compliance resources.

  <Accordion title="How can we ensure we follow best practices to secure our system using Cohere, and how can we communicate that to our clients when they raise concerns about potential vulnerabilities associated with using AI?">
    When it comes to using AI models securely, two important areas stand out.

    #### 1. Model Security and Safety

    This responsibility lies primarily with the model provider, and at Cohere, we are deeply committed to ensuring responsible AI development. Our team includes some of the top experts in AI security and safety. We lead through various initiatives, including governance and compliance frameworks, safety and security protocols, strict data controls for model training, and industry thought leadership.

    #### 2. Secure Application Development with Cohere Models:

    While Cohere ensures the model's security, customers are responsible for building and deploying applications using these models securely. A strong focus on a Secure Product Lifecycle is essential, and our models integrate seamlessly into this process. Core security principles remain as relevant in the AI space as elsewhere. For example, robust authentication protocols should exist for all users, services, and micro-services. Secrets, tokens, and credentials must be tightly controlled and regularly monitored.

    #### Our recommendations:

    * Implement responsible AI and governance policies in your AI development process, focusing on customer safety and security.
    * Continuously monitor the performance of your applications and promptly address any issues that arise.

    We also regularly share insights and best practices on AI security on our blog. Here are a few examples: [1](https://cohere.com/blog/how-generative-ai-has-changed-security-2), [2](https://cohere.com/blog/tackling-ai-security-risks-with-eyes-wide-open), [3](https://cohere.com/blog/building-robust-enterprise-ai-solutions-insights-on-llm-performance-safety-and-future-trends).
