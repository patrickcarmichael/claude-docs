## Pricing Mechanisms

Cohere models can be deployed to serverless API endpoints with pay-as-you-go billing. This kind of deployment provides a way to consume models as an API without hosting them on your subscription, while keeping the enterprise security and compliance that organizations need.

To get the most updated list of available models, visit the [Azure marketplace here](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps?page=1\&search=cohere).
