## Description

Command R7B is the smallest and fastest model in our R family of enterprise-focused [large language models](https://docs.cohere.com/v1/docs/the-cohere-platform#large-language-models-llms) (LLMs). With a context window of 128K and a compact architecture, Command R7B offers state-of-the-art performance across a variety of real-world tasks, and it is especially good at high throughput, latency-sensitive applications like chatbots and code assistants. What's more, it's small size also unlocks dramatically cheaper deployment infrastructure--such as consumer GPUs and CPUs--which means it can be used for on-device inference.

Command R7B is available today on the Cohere Platform as well as accessible on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/CohereForAI/c4ai-command-r7b-12-2024), or you can access it in the SDK with `command-r7b-12-2024`.
