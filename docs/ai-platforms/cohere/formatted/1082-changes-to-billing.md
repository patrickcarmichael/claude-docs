## Changes to Billing

Going forward, Cohere is implementing the following two billing policies:

* When a user accrues \$150 of outstanding debts, a warning email will be sent alerting them of upcoming charges.
* When a self-serve customer (i.e. a non-contracted organization with a credit card on file) accumulates \$250 in outstanding debts, a charge will be forced via Stripe.
