## Go to Production

You must acknowledge Cohere’s SaaS agreement and terms of service. Your organization must also read and recognize our model limitations, model cards, and data statement.

You will be asked if your usage of Cohere API involves any of the sensitive use cases outlined in our usage guidelines. Following your acknowledgment of our terms, you will be able to generate and use a production key immediately. However, if you indicate your usage involves a sensitive use case, your production key may be rate limited the same as a trial key until our safety team reaches out and manually approves your use case. Reviews on sensitive use cases will take no longer than 72 business hours.
