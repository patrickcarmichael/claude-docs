## What is Azure AI Foundry

Azure AI Foundry is a trusted platform that empowers developers to build and deploy innovative, responsible AI applications. It offers an enterprise-grade environment with cutting-edge tools and models, ensuring a safe and secure development process.

The platform facilitates collaboration, allowing teams to work together on the full lifecycle of application development. With Azure AI Foundry, developers can explore a wide range of models, services, and capabilities to build AI applications that meet their specific goals.

Hubs are the primary top-level Azure resource for AI Foundry. They provide a central way for a team to govern security, connectivity, and computing resources across playgrounds and projects. Once a hub is created, developers can create projects from it and access shared company resources without needing an IT administrator's repeated help.

Your new project will be added under your current hub, which provides security, governance controls, and shared configurations that all projects can use. Project workspaces that are created using a hub inherit the same security settings and shared resource access. Teams can create project workspaces as needed to organize their work, isolate data, and/or restrict access.
