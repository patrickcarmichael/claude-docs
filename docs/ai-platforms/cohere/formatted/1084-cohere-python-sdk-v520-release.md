## Cohere Python SDK v5.2.0 release

> Stay up to date with our Python SDK update, including local tokenizer defaults and new required fields.

We've released an additional update for our Python SDK! Here are the highlights.

* The tokenize and detokenize functions in the Python SDK now default to using a *local* tokenizer.
* When using the local tokenizer, the response will not include `token_strings`, but users can revert to using the hosted tokenizer by specifying `offline=False`.
* Also, `model` will now be a required field.
* For more information, see the guide for [tokens and tokenizers](/docs/tokens-and-tokenizers).
