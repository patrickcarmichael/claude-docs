You will use the same method for running a multi-turn conversation when you learn about other use cases such as RAG (Part 6) and tool use (Part 7).

But to fully leverage these other capabilities, you will need another type of language model that generates text representations, or embeddings.

In Part 4, you will learn how text embeddings can power an important use case for RAG, which is [semantic search](/v2/docs/semantic-search-with-cohere).
