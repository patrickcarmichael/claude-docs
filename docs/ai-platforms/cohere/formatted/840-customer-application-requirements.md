## Customer Application Requirements

You must ensure your Customer Application complies with the Universal Requirements of this Usage Policy and that users of your Customer Application understand and are required to comply with substantially similar requirements.

If your Customer Application is public-facing and interacts with human users (including consumers), like chatbots and interactive AI agents, you must: (1) disclose to the users that they are interacting with an AI system rather than a human; and (2) if the Customer Application interacts with minors, comply with any specific child safety regulations and implement appropriate additional safety controls such as age verification and content moderation.
