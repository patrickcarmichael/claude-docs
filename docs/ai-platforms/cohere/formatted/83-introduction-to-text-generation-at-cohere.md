## Introduction to Text Generation at Cohere

> This page describes how a large language model generates textual output.

Large language models are impressive for many reasons, but among the most prominent is their ability to quickly generate text. With just a little bit of prompting, they can crank out conceptual explanations, blog posts, web copy, poetry, and almost anything else. Their style can be tweaked to be suitable for children and adults, technical people and laymen, and they can be asked to work in dozens of different natural languages.

In this article, we'll cover some of the basics of what makes this functionality possible. If you'd like to skip straight to a more hands-on treatment, check out "[Using the Chat API](/docs/chat-api)."
