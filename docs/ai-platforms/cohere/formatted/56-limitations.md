## Limitations

Be aware that [tool use](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/tools) isn't supported with this model.

Also, it's important to mention that Command A Vision can accept images as input, but doesn't generate them.

For more detailed breakdowns of these and other applications, check out [our cookbooks](https://github.com/cohere-ai/cohere-developer-experience/tree/main/notebooks/guides/vision). To learn more about how token counts work, the maximum number of images, and so on, check out our dedicated [Image Inputs](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/image-inputs) document.
