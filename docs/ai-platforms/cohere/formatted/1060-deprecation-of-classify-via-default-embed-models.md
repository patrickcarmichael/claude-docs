## Deprecation of Classify via default Embed Models

> Usage of Classify endpoint via the default Embed models is now deprecated. Usage of Classify endpoint via a fine-tuned Embed model is not affected.

Effective January 31st, 2025, we are deprecating the use of default Embed models with the Classify endpoint.

This deprecation does not affect usage of the Classify endpoint with fine-tuned Embed models. Fine-tuned models continue to be fully supported and are recommended for achieving optimal classification performance.

For guidance on implementing Classify with fine-tuned models, please refer to our [Classify fine-tuning documentation](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/classify-fine-tuning).
