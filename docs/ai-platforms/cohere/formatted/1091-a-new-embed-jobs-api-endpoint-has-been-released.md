## A new Embed Jobs API Endpoint Has Been Released

The [Embed Jobs API](/docs/embed-jobs-api) was designed for users who want to leverage the power of retrieval over large corpuses of information. Encoding a large volume of documents with an API can be tedious and difficult, but the Embed Jobs API makes it a breeze to handle encoding workflows involving 100,000 documents, or more!

The API works in conjunction with `co.embed()`. For more information, [consult the docs](/docs/embed-jobs-api).
