## Overview

Structured Outputs is a feature that forces the LLM’s response to strictly follow a schema specified by the user. When Structured Outputs is turned on, the LLM will generate structured data that follows the desired schema, provided by the user, 100% of the time. This increases the reliability of LLMs in enterprise applications where downstream applications expect the LLM output to be correctly formatted. With Structured Outputs, hallucinated fields and entries in structured data can be reliably eliminated.
