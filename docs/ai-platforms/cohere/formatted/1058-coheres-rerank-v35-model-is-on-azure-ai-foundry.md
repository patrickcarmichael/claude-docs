## Cohere's Rerank v3.5 Model is on Azure AI Foundry!

> Release announcement for the ability to work with Cohere Rerank v3.5 models in the Azure's AI Foundry.

In December 2024, Cohere released [Rerank v3.5 model](https://docs.cohere.com/changelog/rerank-v3.5). It demonstrates SOTA performance on multilingual retrieval, reasoning, and tasks in domains as varied as finance, eCommerce, hospitality, project management, and email/messaging retrieval.

This model has been available through the Cohere API, but today we’re pleased to announce that it can also be utilized through Microsoft Azure's AI Foundry!
