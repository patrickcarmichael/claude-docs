## Cohere's LLMs

Cohere allows developers and enterprises to build LLM-powered applications. We do that by creating world-class models, along with the supporting platform required to deploy them securely and privately.

The Command family of models includes [Command A](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/command-a), [Command R7B](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/command-r7b), [Command R+](/docs/command-r-plus), and [Command R](/docs/command-r). Together, they are the text-generation LLMs powering conversational agents, summarization, copywriting, and similar use cases. They work through the [Chat](/reference/chat) endpoint, which can be used with or without [retrieval augmented generation](/docs/retrieval-augmented-generation-rag) RAG.

[Rerank](https://cohere.com/blog/rerank/) is the fastest way to inject the intelligence of a language model into an existing search system. It can be accessed via the [Rerank](/reference/rerank-1) endpoint.

[Embed](https://cohere.com/models/embed) improves the accuracy of search, classification, clustering, and RAG results. It also powers the [Embed](/reference/embed) and [Classify](/reference/classify) endpoints.
