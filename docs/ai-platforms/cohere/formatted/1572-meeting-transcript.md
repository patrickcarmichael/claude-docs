## meeting transcript

PhD F: As opposed to the rest of us
PhD D: Well comment OK I I remind that me my first objective eh in the project is to to study difference parameters to to find a a good solution to detect eh the overlapping zone in eh speech recorded But eh tsk comment ehhh comment In that way comment I I I begin to to study and to analyze the ehn the recorded speech eh the different session to to find and to locate and to mark eh the the different overlapping zone And eh so eh I was eh I am transcribing the the first session and I I have found eh eh one thousand acoustic events eh besides the overlapping zones eh I I I mean the eh breaths eh aspiration eh eh talk eh eh clap eh comment I do not know what is the different names eh you use to to name the the pause n speech
Grad G: Oh I do not think we ve been doing it at that level of detail So
PhD D: Eh I I I do I do not need to to to mmm to m to label the the different acoustic but I prefer because eh I would like to to study if eh I I will find eh eh a good eh parameters eh to detect overlapping I would like to to to test these parameters eh with the another eh eh acoustic events to nnn to eh to find what is the ehm the false eh the false eh hypothesis eh nnn which eh are produced when we use the the ehm this eh parameter eh I mean pitch eh eh difference eh feature
PhD A: You know I think some of these that are the nonspeech overlapping events may be difficult even for humans to tell that there s two there I mean if it s a tapping sound you would not necessarily or you know something like that it would be it might be hard to know that it was two separate events
Grad G: Well You were not talking about just overlaps were you ? You were just talking about acoustic events
PhD D: I I I I t I t I talk eh about eh acoustic events in general but eh my my objective eh will be eh to study eh overlapping zone Eh ? comment n Eh in twelve minutes I found eh eh one thousand acoustic events
Professor E: How many overlaps were there in it ? No no how many of them were the overlaps of speech though ?
PhD D: How many ? Eh almost eh three hundred eh in one session in five eh in forty five minutes Alm Three hundred overlapping zone With the overlapping zone overlapping speech speech what eh different duration
Postdoc B: Does this ? So if you had an overlap involving three people how many times was that counted ?
PhD D: three people two people Eh I would like to consider eh one people with difference noise eh in the background be
Professor E: No no but I think what she s asking is pause if at some particular for some particular stretch you had three people talking instead of two did you call that one event ?
PhD D: Oh Oh I consider one event eh for th for that eh for all the zone This th I I I con I consider I consider eh an acoustic event the overlapping zone the period where three speaker or eh are talking together
Grad G: So let s say me and Jane are talking at the same time and then Liz starts talking also over all of us How many events would that be ?
PhD D: So I do not understand
Grad G: So two people are talking comment and then a third person starts talking Is there an event right here ?
PhD D: Eh no No no For me is the overlapping zone because because you you have s you have more one eh more one voice eh eh produced in a in in a moment
Grad G: So i if two or more people are talking
Professor E: OK So I think We just wanted to understand how you are defining it So then in the region between since there there is some continuous region in between regions where there is only one person speaking And one contiguous region like that you are calling an event Is it Are you calling the beginning or the end of it the event or are you calling the entire length of it the event ?
PhD D: I consider the the nnn the nnn nnn eh the entirety eh eh all all the time there were the voice has overlapped This is the idea But eh I I do not distinguish between the the numbers of eh speaker I m not considering eh the the ehm eh the fact of eh eh for example what did you say ? Eh at first eh eh two talkers are eh speaking and eh eh a third person eh join to to that For me it s eh it s eh all overlap zone with eh several numbers of speakers is eh eh the same acoustic event Wi but without any mark between the zone of the overlapping zone with two speakers eh speaking together and the zone with the three speakers
Postdoc B: That would j just be one
PhD D: Eh with eh a beginning mark and the ending mark Because eh for me is the is the zone with eh some kind of eh distortion the spectral I do not mind By the moment by the moment
Grad G: Well but But you could imagine that three people talking has a different spectral characteristic than two
PhD D: I I do not but eh but eh I have to study comment What will happen in a general way
Grad G: So You had to start somewhere
PhD C: So there s a lot of overlap
PhD D: I I do not know what eh will will happen with the
Grad G: That s a lot of overlap
Professor E: So again that s that s three three hundred in forty five minutes that are that are speakers just speakers
Postdoc B: But a a a th
Professor E: So that s about eight per minute
Postdoc B: But a thousand events in twelve minutes that s
PhD C: But that can include taps
Postdoc B: Well but a thousand taps in eight minutes is a l in twelve minutes is a lot
PhD D: I I con I consider I consider acoustic events eh the silent too
Grad G: Silence starting or silence ending
PhD D: silent ground to bec to detect eh because I consider acoustic event all the things are not eh speech In ge in in in a general point of view
Professor E: OK so how many of those thousand were silence ?
PhD F: Not speech not speech or too much speech
Professor E: Right So how many of those thousand were silence silent sections ?
PhD D: silent I I I I do not I I have not the eh I I would like to to do a stylistic study
