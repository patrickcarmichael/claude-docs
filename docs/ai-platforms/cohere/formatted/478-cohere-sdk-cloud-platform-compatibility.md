## Cohere SDK Cloud Platform Compatibility

> This page describes various places you can use Cohere's SDK.

To maximize convenience in building on and switching between Cohere-supported environments, we have developed SDKs that seamlessly support whichever backend you choose. This allows you to start developing your project with one backend while maintaining the flexibility to switch, should the need arise.

Note that the code snippets presented in this document should be more than enough to get you started, but if you end up switching from one environment to another there will be some small changes you need to make to how you import and initialize the SDK.
