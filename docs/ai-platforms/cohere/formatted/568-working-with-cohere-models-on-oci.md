## Working With Cohere Models on OCI

* [Embeddings generation](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/generative-ai/use-playground-embed.htm#playground-embed)

And OCI offers three ways to perform these workloads:

* The console
* The CLI
* The API

In the sections that follow, we'll briefly outline how to use each, and link out to other documentation to fill in any remaining gaps.

### The Console

OCI offers a console through which you can perform many generative AI tasks. It allows you to select your region and the model you wish to use, then pass a prompt to the underlying model, configuring parameters as you wish.

If you want to use the console for [chat](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/generative-ai/use-playground-chat.htm), [text generation](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/generative-ai/use-playground-generate.htm#playground-generate), [summarization](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/generative-ai/use-playground-summarize.htm#playground-summarize), and [embeddings](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/generative-ai/use-playground-embed.htm#playground-embed), visit those links and select "console."

### The CLI

With OCI's command line interface (CLI), it's possible to use Cohere models to generate text, get embeddings, or extract information.

If you want to use the console for [text generation](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/generative-ai/use-playground-generate.htm#playground-generate), [summarization](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/generative-ai/use-playground-summarize.htm#playground-summarize), and [embeddings](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/generative-ai/use-playground-embed.htm#playground-embed), visit those links and select "CLI."

### The API

If you're trying to use Cohere models on OCI programmatically -- i.e. as part of software development, or while building an application -- you'll likely want to use the API.
