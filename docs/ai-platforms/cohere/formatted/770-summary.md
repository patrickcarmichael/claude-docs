## Summary

In this tutorial, we learned about:

* How to set up a SQLite database for structured data
* How to create a function to execute SQL queries
* How to build an agent for querying the database
* How to run the agent

By implementing these techniques, we've further expanded our agentic RAG system to handle structured data in the form of SQL databases. This allows for more powerful and flexible querying capabilities, especially when dealing with large datasets or complex relationships between data.

This tutorial completes our exploration of structured data handling in the agentic RAG system, covering both tabular data (using pandas) and relational databases (using SQL). These capabilities significantly enhance the system's ability to work with diverse data formats and structures.
