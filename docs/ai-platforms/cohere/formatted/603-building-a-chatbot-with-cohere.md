As its name implies, the Chat endpoint enables developers to build chatbots that can handle conversations. At the core of a conversation is a multi-turn dialog between the user and the chatbot. This requires the chatbot to have the state (or “memory”) of all the previous turns to maintain the state of the conversation.

In this tutorial, you'll learn about:

* Sending messages to the model
* Crafting a system message
* Maintaining conversation state

You'll learn these by building an onboarding assistant for new hires.
