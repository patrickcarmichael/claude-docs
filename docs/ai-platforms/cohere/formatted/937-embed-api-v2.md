## Embed API (v2)

POST https://api.cohere.com/v2/embed
Content-Type: application/json

This endpoint returns text embeddings. An embedding is a list of floating point numbers that captures semantic information about the text that it represents.

Embeddings can be used to create text classifiers as well as empower semantic search. To learn more about embeddings, see the embedding page.

If you want to learn more how to use the embedding model, have a look at the [Semantic Search Guide](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/semantic-search).
