> Guide on using Cohere's Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) capabilities covering the Chat, Embed, and Rerank endpoints (API v2).

This section expands on the [basic RAG usage](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/retrieval-augmented-generation-rag) by demonstrating a more complete example that includes:

* Building RAG for chatbots (involving multi-turn conversations).
