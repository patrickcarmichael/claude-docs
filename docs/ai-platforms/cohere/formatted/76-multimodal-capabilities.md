## Multimodal Capabilities

Aya Vision’s multimodal capabilities enable it to understand content across different media types, including text and images as input. Purpose-built to unify cultures, geographies, and people, Aya Vision is optimized for elite performance in 23 different languages. Its image captioning capabilities allow it to generate descriptive captions for images, and interpret images dynamically to answer various questions about images. Likewise, Aya Vision allows question answering, and translation across these materials, whether written or image based, laying a foundation to bridge communication and collaboration divides.

Like [Aya Expanse](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/aya), Aya Vision is highly proficient in 23 languages, making it a valuable tool for researchers, academics, and developers working on multilingual projects.
