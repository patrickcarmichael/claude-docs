## Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes you have the following:

* An Elastic Cloud account through [Elastic Cloud](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/cloud/current/ec-getting-started.html), available with a [free trial](https://cloud.elastic.co/registration?utm_source=github\&utm_content=elasticsearch-labs-notebook)
* A Cohere production API Key. Get your API Key at this [link](https://dashboard.cohere.com/welcome/login?redirect_uri=%2Fapi-keys) if you don't have one
* Python 3.7 or higher

Note: While this tutorial integrates Cohere with an Elastic Cloud [serverless](https://docs.elastic.co/serverless/elasticsearch/get-started) project, you can also integrate with your self-managed Elasticsearch deployment or Elastic Cloud deployment by simply switching from the [serverless](https://docs.elastic.co/serverless/elasticsearch/clients) to the general [language client](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/index.html).
