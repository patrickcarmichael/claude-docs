# Edit your app

Source: https://docs.streamlit.io/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/manage-your-app/edit-your-app


You can edit your app from any development environment of your choice. Streamlit Community Cloud will monitor your repository and automatically copy any file changes you commit. You will immediately see commits reflected in your deployed app for most changes (such as edits to your app's Python files).

Community Cloud also makes it easy to skip the work of setting up a development environment. With a few simple clicks, you can configure a development environment using GitHub Codespaces.

## Edit your app with GitHub Codespaces

Spin up a cloud-based development environment for your deployed app in minutes. You can run your app within your codespace to enjoy experimenting in a safe, sandboxed environment. When you are done editing your code, you can commit your changes to your repo or just leave them in your codespace to return to later.

### Create a codespace for your deployed app
