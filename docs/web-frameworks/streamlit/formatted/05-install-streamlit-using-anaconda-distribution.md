# Install Streamlit using Anaconda Distribution

Source: https://docs.streamlit.io/get-started/installation/anaconda-distribution


This page walks you through installing Streamlit locally using Anaconda Distribution. At the end, you'll build a simple "Hello world" app and run it. You can read more about [Getting started with Anaconda Distribution](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/getting-started/) in Anaconda's docs. If you prefer to manage your Python environments via command line, check out how to [Install Streamlit using command line](/get-started/installation/command-line).

## Prerequisites

1. **A code editor**

   Anaconda Distribution includes Python and basically everything you need to get started.
   The only thing left for you to choose is a code editor.

   Our favorite editor is [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), which is also what we
   use in all our tutorials.

1. **Knowledge about environment managers**

   Environment managers create virtual environments to isolate Python package installations between
   projects. For a detailed introduction to Python environments, check out
   [Python Virtual Environments: A Primer](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/).

   But don't worry! In this guide we'll teach you how to install and use an environment manager
   (Anaconda).

## Install Anaconda Distribution

1. Go to [anaconda.com/download](https://www.anaconda.com/download).

2. Install Anaconda Distribution for your OS.

## Create an environment using Anaconda Navigator

3. Open Anaconda Navigator (the graphical interface included with Anaconda Distribution).

4. You can decline signing in to Anaconda if prompted.

5. In the left menu, click "**Environments**."

6. At the bottom of your environments list, click "**Create**."

7. Enter "streamlitenv" for the name of your environment.

8. Click "**Create**."
