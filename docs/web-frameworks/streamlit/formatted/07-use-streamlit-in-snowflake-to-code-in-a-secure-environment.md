# Use Streamlit in Snowflake to code in a secure environment

Source: https://docs.streamlit.io/get-started/installation/streamlit-in-snowflake


Snowflake is a single, global platform that powers the Data Cloud. If you want to use a secure platform with role-based access control, this is the option for you! This page walks you through creating a trial Snowflake account and building a "Hello world" app. Your trial account comes with an account credit so you can try out the service without entering any payment information.

<Note>

For more information, see [Limitations and unsupported features](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/streamlit/limitations) in the Snowflake documentation.

</Note>

## Prerequisites

All you need is an email address! Everything else happens in your 30-day trial account.

## Create an account

1. Go to <SnowflakeTrial/>. (This link will open in a new tab.)

1. Fill in your information, and click "**CONTINUE**."

1. Select "**Standard**" for your Snowflake edition and "**Amazon Web Services**" for your cloud provider.

1. Choose the region nearest you, accept the terms, and click "**GET STARTED**."
