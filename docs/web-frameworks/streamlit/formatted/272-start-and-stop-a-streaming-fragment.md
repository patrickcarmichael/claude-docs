# Start and stop a streaming fragment

Source: https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/tutorials/execution-flow/start-and-stop-fragment-auto-reruns


Streamlit lets you turn functions into [fragments](/develop/concepts/architecture/fragments), which can rerun independently from the full script. Additionally, you can tell Streamlit to rerun a fragment at a set time interval. This is great for streaming data or monitoring processes. You may want the user to start and stop this live streaming. To do this, programmatically set the `run_every` parameter for your fragment.

## Applied concepts

- Use a fragment to stream live data.
- Start and stop a fragment from automatically rerunning.

## Prerequisites

- This tutorial requires the following version of Streamlit:

  ```text
  streamlit&gt;=1.37.0
  ```python
- You should have a clean working directory called `your-repository`.
- You should have a basic understanding of fragments.

## Summary

In this example, you'll build an app that streams two data series in a line chart. Your app will gather recent data on the first load of a session and statically display the line chart. Two buttons in the sidebar will allow users to start and stop data streaming to update the chart in real time. You'll use a fragment to manage the frequency and scope of the live updates.

Here's a look at what you'll build:

```python
import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from datetime import datetime, timedelta


def get_recent_data(last_timestamp):
    """Generate and return data from last timestamp to now, at most 60 seconds."""
    now = datetime.now()
    if now - last_timestamp &gt; timedelta(seconds=60):
        last_timestamp = now - timedelta(seconds=60)
    sample_time = timedelta(seconds=0.5)  # time between data points
    next_timestamp = last_timestamp + sample_time
    timestamps = np.arange(next_timestamp, now, sample_time)
    sample_values = np.random.randn(len(timestamps), 2)

    data = pd.DataFrame(sample_values, index=timestamps, columns=["A", "B"])
    return data


if "data" not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.data = get_recent_data(datetime.now() - timedelta(seconds=60))

if "stream" not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.stream = False


def toggle_streaming():
    st.session_state.stream = not st.session_state.stream


st.title("Data feed")
st.sidebar.slider(
    "Check for updates every: (seconds)", 0.5, 5.0, value=1.0, key="run_every"
)
st.sidebar.button(
    "Start streaming", disabled=st.session_state.stream, on_click=toggle_streaming
)
st.sidebar.button(
    "Stop streaming", disabled=not st.session_state.stream, on_click=toggle_streaming
)

if st.session_state.stream is True:
    run_every = st.session_state.run_every
else:
    run_every = None


@st.fragment(run_every=run_every)
def show_latest_data():
    last_timestamp = st.session_state.data.index[-1]
    st.session_state.data = pd.concat(
        [st.session_state.data, get_recent_data(last_timestamp)]
    )
    st.session_state.data = st.session_state.data[-100:]
    st.line_chart(st.session_state.data)


show_latest_data()
```python
