# Share previews

Source: https://docs.streamlit.io/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/share-your-app/share-previews


Social media sites generate a card with a title, preview image, and description when you share a link. This feature is called a "share preview." In the same way, when you share a link to a public Streamlit app on social media, a share preview is also generated. Here's an example of a share preview for a public Streamlit app posted on Twitter:

<div>{{ marginLeft: '3em' }}&gt;
    <Flex>
<Image caption="Share preview for a public Streamlit app" src="/images/streamlit-community-cloud/share-preview-twitter-annotated.png"/>
</Flex>
</div>
