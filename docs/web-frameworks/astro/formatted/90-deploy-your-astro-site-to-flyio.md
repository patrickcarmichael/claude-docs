# Deploy your Astro Site to Fly.io

> How to deploy your Astro site to the web using Fly.io.

You can deploy your Astro project to [Fly.io](https://fly.io/), a platform for running full stack apps and databases close to your users.

## Project Configuration

[Section titled “Project Configuration”](#project-configuration)

Your Astro project can be deployed to Fly.io as a static site, or as a server-side rendered site (SSR).

### Static Site

[Section titled “Static Site”](#static-site)

Your Astro project is a static site by default. You don’t need any extra configuration to deploy a static Astro site to Fly.io.

### Adapter for SSR

[Section titled “Adapter for SSR”](#adapter-for-ssr)

To enable on-demand rendering in your Astro project and deploy on Fly.io, add [the Node.js adapter](/en/guides/integrations-guide/node/).

## How to deploy

[Section titled “How to deploy”](#how-to-deploy)

1. [Sign up for Fly.io](https://fly.io/docs/getting-started/log-in-to-fly/#first-time-or-no-fly-account-sign-up-for-fly) if you haven’t already.

2. [Install `flyctl`](https://fly.io/docs/hands-on/install-flyctl/), your Fly.io app command center.

3. Run the following command in your terminal.

   ```bash
   fly launch
   ```jsx
   `flyctl` will automatically detect Astro, configure the correct settings, build your image, and deploy it to the Fly.io platform.

## Generating your Astro Dockerfile

[Section titled “Generating your Astro Dockerfile”](#generating-your-astro-dockerfile)

If you don’t already have a Dockerfile, `fly launch` will generate one for you, as well as prepare a `fly.toml` file. For pages rendered on demand, this Dockerfile will include the appropriate start command and environment variables.

You can instead create your own Dockerfile using [Dockerfile generator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@flydotio/dockerfile) and then run using the command `npx dockerfile` for Node applications or `bunx dockerfile` for Bun applications.
