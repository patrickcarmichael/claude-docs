# Check in: Unit 3 - Components

> Tutorial: Build your first Astro blog —
Build Astro components to reuse code for common elements across your website

Now that you have `.astro` and `.md` files generating entire pages on your website, it’s time to make and reuse smaller bits of HTML with Astro components!

## Looking ahead

[Section titled “Looking ahead”](#looking-ahead)

In this unit, you’ll learn how to create **Astro components** to reuse code for common elements across your website.

You’ll build:

* A Navigation component that presents a menu of links to your pages
* A Footer component to include at the bottom of each page
* A Social Media component, used in the Footer, that links to profile pages
* An interactive Menu component to toggle the Navigation on mobile

Along the way, you’ll use CSS and JavaScript to build a responsive design that reacts to screen sizes and user input.

## Checklist
