# @astrojs/partytown

> Learn how to use the @astrojs/partytown integration in your Astro project.

This **[Astro integration](/en/guides/integrations-guide/)** enables [Partytown](https://partytown.qwik.dev/) in your Astro project.

## Why Astro Partytown

[Section titled “Why Astro Partytown”](#why-astro-partytown)

Partytown is a lazy-loaded library to help relocate resource intensive scripts into a [web worker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API), and off of the [main thread](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Main_thread).

If you’re using third-party scripts for things like analytics or ads, Partytown is a great way to make sure that they don’t slow down your site.

The Astro Partytown integration installs Partytown for you and makes sure it’s enabled on all of your pages.

## Installation

[Section titled “Installation”](#installation)

Astro includes an `astro add` command to automate the setup of official integrations. If you prefer, you can [install integrations manually](#manual-install) instead.

Run one of the following commands in a new terminal window.

* npm

  ```sh
  npx astro add partytown
  ```jsx
* pnpm

  ```sh
  pnpm astro add partytown
  ```jsx
* Yarn

  ```sh
  yarn astro add partytown
  ```jsx
If you run into any issues, [feel free to report them to us on GitHub](https://github.com/withastro/astro/issues) and try the manual installation steps below.

### Manual Install

[Section titled “Manual Install”](#manual-install)

First, install the `@astrojs/partytown` package:

* npm

  ```sh
  npm install @astrojs/partytown
  ```jsx
* pnpm

  ```sh
  pnpm add @astrojs/partytown
  ```jsx
* Yarn

  ```sh
  yarn add @astrojs/partytown
  ```jsx
Then, apply the integration to your `astro.config.*` file using the `integrations` property:

astro.config.mjs

```diff
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
+import partytown from '@astrojs/partytown';


export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  integrations: [partytown()],
});
```jsx
## Usage

[Section titled “Usage”](#usage)

Partytown should be ready to go with zero config. If you have an existing 3rd party script on your site, try adding the `type="text/partytown"` attribute:

```html
<script type="text/partytown" src="fancy-analytics.js"></script>
```jsx
If you open the “Network” tab from [your browser’s dev tools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/open/), you should see the `partytown` proxy intercepting this request.

## Configuration

[Section titled “Configuration”](#configuration)

To configure this integration, pass a ‘config’ object to the `partytown()` function call in `astro.config.mjs`.

astro.config.mjs

```js
export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  integrations: [
    partytown({
      config: {
        // options go here
      },
    }),
  ],
});
```jsx
This mirrors the [Partytown config object](https://partytown.qwik.dev/configuration/) and all options can be set in `partytown.config`. Some common configuration options for Astro projects are described on this page.

### Enabling debug mode

[Section titled “Enabling debug mode”](#enabling-debug-mode)

Partytown ships with a `debug` mode; enable or disable it by passing `true` or `false` to `config.debug`. If [`debug` mode](https://partytown.qwik.dev/debugging) is enabled, it will output detailed logs to the browser console.

If this option isn’t set, `debug` mode will be on by default in [dev](/en/reference/cli-reference/#astro-dev) or [preview](/en/reference/cli-reference/#astro-preview) mode.

astro.config.mjs

```js
export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  integrations: [
    partytown({
      // Example: Disable debug mode.
      config: { debug: false },
    }),
  ],
});
```jsx
### Forwarding variables

[Section titled “Forwarding variables”](#forwarding-variables)

Third-party scripts typically add variables to the `window` object so that you can communicate with them throughout your site. But when a script is loaded in a web-worker, it doesn’t have access to that global `window` object.

To solve this, Partytown can “patch” variables to the global window object and forward them to the appropriate script.

You can specify which variables to forward with the `config.forward` option. [Read more in Partytown’s documentation.](https://partytown.qwik.dev/forwarding-events)

astro.config.mjs

```js
export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  integrations: [
    partytown({
      // Example: Add dataLayer.push as a forwarding-event.
      config: {
        forward: ['dataLayer.push'],
      },
    }),
  ],
});
```jsx
### Proxying requests

[Section titled “Proxying requests”](#proxying-requests)

Some third-party scripts may require [proxying](https://partytown.qwik.dev/proxying-requests/) through `config.resolveUrl()`, which runs inside the service worker. You can set this configuration option to check for a specific URL, and optionally return a proxied URL instead:

astro.config.mjs

```js
export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  integrations: [
    partytown({
      // Example: proxy Facebook's analytics script
      config: {
        resolveUrl: (url) => {
          const proxyMap = {
            "connect.facebook.net": "my-proxy.com"
          }
          url.hostname = proxyMap[url.hostname] || url.hostname;
          return url;
        },
      }
    }),
  ],
});
```jsx
However since the `config` object is serialized when sent to the client, some limitations on functions passed to your configuration apply:

* Functions cannot reference anything outside of the function scope.
* Functions can only be written in JavaScript.

In some advanced use cases, you may need to pass data to this function while initializing Partytown. To do so, you can set `resolveUrl()` on `window.partytown` instead of the integration config:

Head.astro

```astro
---
const proxyMap = {
  "connect.facebook.net": "my-proxy.com"
};
---


<script is:inline set:html={`
  window.partytown = {
    resolveUrl: (url) => {
      const proxyMap = ${JSON.stringify(proxyMap)};
      url.hostname = proxyMap[url.hostname] || url.hostname;
      return url;
    },
  };
`} />
```jsx
Note that the integration config will override `window.partytown` if you set a property in both.
