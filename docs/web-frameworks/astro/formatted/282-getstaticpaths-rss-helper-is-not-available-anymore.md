# getStaticPaths RSS helper is not available anymore.

Deprecated

Deprecated since Astro 4.0. The RSS helper no longer exists with an error fallback.

> **GetStaticPathsRemovedRSSHelper**: The RSS helper has been removed from `getStaticPaths`. Try the new @astrojs/rss package instead.

## What went wrong?

[Section titled “What went wrong?”](#what-went-wrong)

`getStaticPaths` no longer expose an helper for generating a RSS feed. We recommend migrating to the [@astrojs/rss](/en/recipes/rss/#setting-up-astrojsrss)integration instead.
