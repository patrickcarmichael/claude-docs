# Check in: Unit 5 - Astro API

> Tutorial: Build your first Astro blog —
Fetching and using data from project files to dynamically generate pages content and routes

Now that you have some blog posts, it’s time to use Astro’s API to work with your files!

## Looking ahead

[Section titled “Looking ahead”](#looking-ahead)

In this unit, you’ll supercharge your blog with an index page, tag pages, and an RSS feed.

Along the way, you’ll learn how to use:

* `import.meta.glob()` to access data from files in your project
* `getStaticPaths()` to create multiple pages (routes) at once
* The Astro RSS package to create an RSS feed

## Checklist

[Section titled “Checklist”](#checklist)

* I am ready to add some blog features to my Astro project!
