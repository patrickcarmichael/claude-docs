# Unknown Content Collection Error.

## What went wrong?

[Section titled “What went wrong?”](#what-went-wrong)

Astro encountered an unknown error loading your content collections. This can be caused by certain errors inside your `src/content.config.ts` file or some internal errors.

If you can reliably cause this error to happen, we’d appreciate if you could [open an issue](https://astro.build/issues/)
