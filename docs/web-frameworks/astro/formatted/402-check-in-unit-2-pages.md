# Check in: Unit 2 - Pages

> Tutorial: Build your first Astro blog —
Create, style, and link to pages posts on your site

Now that you have a working site on the web, it’s time to add pages and posts!

## Looking ahead

[Section titled “Looking ahead”](#looking-ahead)

In this unit, you will:

* Create your first Astro pages with the `.astro` syntax
* Add blog posts with Markdown (`.md`) files
* Style an individual page with `<style>`
* Apply global styles across pages

Along the way, you’ll learn how the **two sections of a `.astro` file** work together to create a page, and how to use variables and conditional rendering on your pages.

## Checklist
