## What went wrong?

[Section titled “What went wrong?”](#what-went-wrong)

Astro could not find the index URL of your website. An index page is required so that Astro can create a redirect from the main index page to the localized index page of the default locale when using [`i18n.routing.prefixDefaultLocale`](/en/reference/configuration-reference/#i18nroutingprefixdefaultlocale).
