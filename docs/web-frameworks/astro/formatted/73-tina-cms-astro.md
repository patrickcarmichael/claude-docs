# Tina CMS & Astro

> Add content to your Astro project using Tina as a CMS

[Tina CMS](https://tina.io/) is a Git-backed headless content management system.

## Integrating with Astro

[Section titled “Integrating with Astro”](#integrating-with-astro)

To get started, you’ll need an existing Astro project.

1. Run the following command to install Tina into your Astro project.

   * npm

     ```shell
     npx @tinacms/cli@latest init
     ```jsx
   * pnpm

     ```shell
     pnpm dlx @tinacms/cli@latest init
     ```jsx
   * Yarn

     ```shell
     yarn dlx @tinacms/cli@latest init
     ```jsx
   - When prompted for a Cloud ID, press `Enter` to skip. You’ll generate one later if you want to use Tina Cloud.
   - When prompted “What framework are you using”, choose **Other**.
   - When asked where public assets are stored, press `Enter`.

   After this has finished, you should now have a `.tina` folder in the root of your project and a generated `hello-world.md` file at `content/posts`.

2. Change the `dev` script in `package.json`:

   * npm

     package.json

     ```diff
     {
         "scripts": {
             -"dev": "astro dev",
             +"dev": "tinacms dev -c \"astro dev\""
         }
     }
     ```jsx
   * pnpm

     package.json

     ```diff
     {
         "scripts": {
             -"dev": "astro dev",
             +"dev": "tinacms dev -c \"astro dev\""
         }
     }
     ```jsx
   * Yarn

     package.json

     ```diff
     {
         "scripts": {
             -"dev": "astro dev",
             +"dev": "tinacms dev -c \"astro dev\""
         }
     }
     ```jsx
3. TinaCMS is now set up in local mode. Test this by running the `dev` script, then navigating to `/admin/index.html#/collections/post`.

   Editing the “Hello, World!” post will update the `content/posts/hello-world.md` file in your project directory.

4. Set up your Tina collections by editing the `schema.collections` property in `.tina/config.ts`.

   For example, you can add a required “date posted” frontmatter property to our posts:

   .tina/config.ts

   ```diff
   import { defineConfig } from "tinacms";


   // Your hosting provider likely exposes this as an environment variable
   const branch = process.env.HEAD || process.env.VERCEL_GIT_COMMIT_REF || "main";


   export default defineConfig({
     branch,
     clientId: null, // Get this from tina.io
     token: null, // Get this from tina.io
     build: {
       outputFolder: "admin",
       publicFolder: "public",
     },
     media: {
       tina: {
         mediaRoot: "images",
         publicFolder: "public",
       },
     },
     schema: {
       collections: [
         {
           name: "posts",
           label: "Posts",
           path: "src/content/posts",
           format: 'mdx',
           fields: [
             {
               type: "string",
               name: "title",
               label: "Title",
               isTitle: true,
               required: true,
             },
   +          {
   +            type: "datetime",
   +            name: "posted",
   +            label: "Date Posted",
   +            required: true,
   +          },
             {
               type: "rich-text",
               name: "body",
               label: "Body",
               isBody: true,
             },
           ],
         },
       ],
     },
   });
   ```jsx

5. In production, TinaCMS can commit changes directly to your GitHub repository. To set up TinaCMS for production, you can choose to use [Tina Cloud](https://tina.io/docs/tina-cloud/) or self-host the [Tina Data Layer](https://tina.io/docs/self-hosted/overview/). You can [read more about registering for Tina Cloud](https://app.tina.io/register) in the Tina Docs.
