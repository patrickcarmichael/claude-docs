# Experimental client prerendering

**Type:** `boolean`\
**Default:** `false`

**Added in:** `astro@4.2.0`

Enables pre-rendering your prefetched pages on the client in supported browsers.

This feature uses the experimental [Speculation Rules Web API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Speculation_Rules_API) and enhances the default `prefetch` behavior globally to prerender links on the client. You may wish to review the [possible risks when prerendering on the client](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Speculation_Rules_API#unsafe_prefetching) before enabling this feature.

Enable client side prerendering in your `astro.config.mjs` along with any desired `prefetch` configuration options:

astro.config.mjs

```js
{
  prefetch: {
    prefetchAll: true,
    defaultStrategy: 'viewport',
  },
  experimental: {
    clientPrerender: true,
  },
}
```jsx
Continue to use the `data-astro-prefetch` attribute on any `<a />` link on your site to opt in to prefetching. Instead of appending a `<link>` tag to the head of the document or fetching the page with JavaScript, a `<script>` tag will be appended with the corresponding speculation rules.

Client side prerendering requires browser support. If the Speculation Rules API is not supported, `prefetch` will fallback to the supported strategy.

See the [Prefetch Guide](/en/guides/prefetch/) for more `prefetch` options and usage.
