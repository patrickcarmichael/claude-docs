# Payload CMS & Astro

> Add content to your Astro project using Payload as a CMS

[PayloadCMS](https://payloadcms.com/) is a headless open-source content management system that can be used to provide content for your Astro project.

## Integrating with Astro

[Section titled “Integrating with Astro”](#integrating-with-astro)

### Prerequisites

[Section titled “Prerequisites”](#prerequisites)

1. **An Astro project** - If you don’t have an Astro project yet, our [Installation guide](/en/install-and-setup/) will get you up and running in no time.
2. **A MongoDB database** - PayloadCMS will ask you for a MongoDB connection string when creating a new project. You can set one up locally or use [MongoDBAtlas](https://www.mongodb.com/) to host a database on the web for free.
3. **A PayloadCMS REST API** - Create a [PayloadCMS](https://payloadcms.com/docs/getting-started/installation) project and connect it to your MongoDB database during the setup.

Choosing a template

During the PayloadCMS installation, you will be asked if you want to use a template.

Choosing any of the available templates at this step (such as ‘blog’) automatically generates additional collections for you to use. Otherwise, you will need to manually create your PayloadCMS collections.

### Configuring Astro for your PayloadCMS collection

[Section titled “Configuring Astro for your PayloadCMS collection”](#configuring-astro-for-your-payloadcms-collection)

Your Payload project template will contain a file called Posts.ts in `src/collections/`. If you did not choose a template during installation that created a content collection for you, you can create a new Payload CMS Collection by adding this configuration file manually. The example below shows this file for a collection called `posts` that requires `title`, `content`, and `slug` fields:

src/collections/Posts.ts

```ts
import { CollectionConfig } from "payload/types";


const Posts: CollectionConfig = {
  slug: "posts",
  admin: {
    useAsTitle: "title",
  },
  access: {
    read: () => true,
  },


  fields: [
    {
      name: "title",
      type: "text",
      required: true,
    },
    {
      name: "content",
      type: "text",
      required: true,
    },
    {
      name: "slug",
      type: "text",
      required: true,
    },
  ],
};


export default Posts;
```jsx
1. Import and add both `Users` (available in all PayloadCMS projects) and any other collections (e.g. `Posts`) to the available collections in the `payload.config.ts` file.

   src/payload.config.ts

   ```diff
   import { buildConfig } from "payload/config";
   import path from "path";


   +import Users from "./collections/Users";
   +import Posts from "./collections/Posts";


   export default buildConfig({
     serverURL: "http://localhost:4321",
     admin: {
       user: Users.slug,
     },
   +  collections: [Users, Posts],
     typescript: {
       outputFile: path.resolve(__dirname, "payload-types.ts"),
     },
     graphQL: {
       schemaOutputFile: path.resolve(__dirname, "generated-schema.graphql"),
     },
   });
   ```jsx
   This will make a new collection called “Posts” appear in your PayloadCMS Dashboard next to the “Users” collection.

2. Enter the “Posts” collection and create a new post. After saving it, you will notice the API URL appear in the bottom right corner.

3. With the dev server running, open `http://localhost:4321/api/posts` in your browser. You should see a JSON file containing the post you have created as an object.

   ```json
   {
     "docs":[
         {
           "id":"64098b16483b0f06a7e20ed4",
           "title":"Astro & PayloadCMS Title 🚀",
           "content":"Astro & PayloadCMS Content",
           "slug":"astro-payloadcms-slug",
           "createdAt":"2023-03-09T07:30:30.837Z",
           "updatedAt":"2023-03-09T07:30:30.837Z"
         }
     ],
     "totalDocs":1,
     "limit":10,
     "totalPages":1,
     "page":1,
     "pagingCounter":1,
     "hasPrevPage":false,
     "hasNextPage":false,
     "prevPage":null,
     "nextPage":null
   }
   ```jsx
Tip

By default, both Astro and PayloadCMS will use port 4321. You might want to change the PayloadCMS port in the `src/server.ts` file. Don’t forget to update the `serverURL` in `src/payload.config.ts` as well.

### Fetching Data

[Section titled “Fetching Data”](#fetching-data)

Fetch your PayloadCMS data through your site’s unique REST API URL and the route for your content. (By default, PayloadCMS will mount all routes through `/api`.) Then, you can render your data properties using Astro’s `set:html=""` directive.

Together with your post, PayloadCMS will return some top-level metadata. The actual documents are nested within the `docs` array.

For example, to display a list of post titles and their content:

src/pages/index.astro

```astro
---
import HomeLayout from "../layouts/HomeLayout.astro";


const res = await fetch("http://localhost:5000/api/posts") // http://localhost:4321/api/posts by default
const posts = await res.json()
---


<HomeLayout title='Astro Blog'>
  {
    posts.docs.map((post) => (
        <h2 set:html={post.title} />
        <p set:html={post.content} />
    ))
  }
</HomeLayout>
```jsx
## Building a blog with PayloadCMS and Astro

[Section titled “Building a blog with PayloadCMS and Astro”](#building-a-blog-with-payloadcms-and-astro)

Create a blog index page `src/pages/index.astro` to list each of your posts with a link to its own page.

Fetching via the API returns an array of objects (posts) that include, among others, the following properties:

* `title`
* `content`
* `slug`

src/pages/index.astro

```astro
---
import HomeLayout from "../layouts/HomeLayout.astro";


const res = await fetch("http://localhost:5000/api/posts") // http://localhost:4321/api/posts by default
const posts = await res.json()
---


<HomeLayout title='Astro Blog'>
  <h1>Astro + PayloadCMS 🚀</h1>
  <h2>Blog posts list:</h2>
  <ul>
    {
      posts.docs.map((post) =>(
        <li>
          <a href={`posts/${post.slug}`} set:html={post.title} />
        </li>
      ))
    }
  </ul>
</HomeLayout>
```jsx
### Using the PayloadCMS API to generate pages

[Section titled “Using the PayloadCMS API to generate pages”](#using-the-payloadcms-api-to-generate-pages)

Create a page `src/pages/posts/[slug].astro` to [dynamically generate a page](/en/guides/routing/#dynamic-routes) for each post.

src/pages/posts/\[slug].astro

```astro
---
import PostLayout from "../../layouts/PostLayout.astro"


const {title, content} = Astro.props


// The getStaticPaths() is required for static Astro sites.
// If using SSR, you will not need this function.
export async function getStaticPaths() {
    let data = await fetch("http://localhost:5000/api/posts")
    let posts = await data.json()


    return posts.docs.map((post) => {
        return {
            params: {slug: post.slug},
            props: {title: post.title, content: post.content},
        };
    });
}
---
<PostLayout title={title}>
    <article>
        <h1 set:html={title} />
        <p set:html={content} />
    </article>
</PostLayout>
```jsx
