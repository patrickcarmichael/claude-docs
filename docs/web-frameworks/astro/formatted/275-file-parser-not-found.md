# File parser not found

> **FileParserNotFound**: No parser was found for ‘FILE\_NAME’. Pass a parser function (e.g. `parser: csv`) to the `file` loader.

## What went wrong?

[Section titled “What went wrong?”](#what-went-wrong)

The `file` loader can’t determine which parser to use. Please provide a custom parser (e.g. `csv-parse`) to create a collection from your file type.
