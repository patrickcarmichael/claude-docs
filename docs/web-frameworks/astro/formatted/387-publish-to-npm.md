> Learn how to publish Astro components to npm

Building a new Astro component? **Publish it to [npm!](https://npmjs.com/)**

Looking for inspiration? Check out some of our favorite [themes](https://astro.build/themes/) and [components](https://astro.build/integrations/) from the Astro community. You can also [search npm](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=keywords:astro-component,withastro) to see the entire public catalog.

Don’t want to go it alone?
