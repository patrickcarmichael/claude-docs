# Unknown configuration error.

## What went wrong?

[Section titled “What went wrong?”](#what-went-wrong)

Astro encountered an unknown error loading your Astro configuration file. This is often caused by a syntax error in your config and the message should offer more information.

If you can reliably cause this error to happen, we’d appreciate if you could [open an issue](https://astro.build/issues/)
