## What is a backend service?

[Section titled “What is a backend service?”](#what-is-a-backend-service)

A backend service is a cloud-based system that helps you build and manage your backend infrastructure. It provides a set of tools and services for managing databases, user authentication, and other server-side functionality. This enables you to focus on building your applications without having to worry about managing the underlying infrastructure.

## Why would I use a backend service?

[Section titled “Why would I use a backend service?”](#why-would-i-use-a-backend-service)

You might want to consider a backend service if your project has complex server-side needs, for example:

* user sign-ups and authentication
* persistent data storage
* user-uploaded asset storage
* API generation
* realtime communication
* application monitoring
