# Prerendered route generates the same path as another route.

> **PrerenderRouteConflict**: Could not render `PATHNAME` from route `THIS_ROUTE` as it conflicts with higher priority route `WINNING_ROUTE`.

## What went wrong?

[Section titled “What went wrong?”](#what-went-wrong)

Two prerendered routes generate the same path, resulting in a collision. A static path can only be generated by one route.
