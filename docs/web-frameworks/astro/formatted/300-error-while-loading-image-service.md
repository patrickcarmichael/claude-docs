## What went wrong?

[Section titled “What went wrong?”](#what-went-wrong)

There was an error while loading the configured image service. This can be caused by various factors, such as your image service not properly exporting a compatible object in its default export, or an incorrect path.

If you believe that your service is properly configured and this error is wrong, please [open an issue](https://astro.build/issues/).
