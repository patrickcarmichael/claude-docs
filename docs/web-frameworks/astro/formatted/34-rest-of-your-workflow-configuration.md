2. Add the following configuration to your Windsurf MCP settings:

   MCP Configuration

   ```json
   {

         "command": "npx",
         "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "https://mcp.docs.astro.build/mcp"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```jsx
3. Save the configuration and restart Windsurf.

#### Gemini CLI

[Section titled “Gemini CLI”](#gemini-cli)

Gemini CLI is a command-line AI coding tool that can use the Astro Docs MCP server to access documentation while generating Astro code.

You can configure MCP servers at the global level in the `~/.gemini/settings.json` file, or in a `.gemini/settings.json` file in a project root.

.gemini/settings.json

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Astro docs": {
      "httpUrl": "https://mcp.docs.astro.build/mcp",
    }
  }
}
```jsx

#### Zed

[Section titled “Zed”](#zed)

[Zed](https://zed.dev) supports MCP servers when using its AI capabilities. It can use the Astro Docs MCP server to access documentation while performing coding tasks.

Zed doesn’t support streaming HTTP, so it requires a local proxy configuration:

1. Open `~/.config/zed/settings.json` in your editor.

2. Add the following configuration to your Zed MCP settings:

   MCP Configuration

   ```json
   {
     "context_servers": {

#### ChatGPT

[Section titled “ChatGPT”](#chatgpt)

Limited availability

MCP server integration is only available for ChatGPT Pro, Team, and Enterprise users. The setup process is more complex than other tools.

Refer to the [OpenAI MCP documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/mcp#test-and-connect-your-mcp-server) for specific setup instructions.

#### Raycast

[Section titled “Raycast”](#raycast)

[Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/) can connect to MCP servers to enhance its AI capabilities. AI features such as MCP require a [Raycast Pro](https://www.raycast.com/pro) account, so ensure you have upgraded before trying to install. Adding the Astro Docs MCP server allows Raycast to access the latest Astro documentation while answering questions.

Install by clicking the button below:

[Add to Raycast](raycast://mcp/install?%7B%22name%22%3A%22Astro%20docs%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22stdio%22%2C%22command%22%3A%22npx%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22-y%22%2C%20%22mcp-remote%22%2C%20%22https%3A%2F%2Fmcp.docs.astro.build%2Fmcp%22%5D%7D)

### Usage

[Section titled “Usage”](#usage)

Once configured, you can ask your AI tool questions about Astro, and it will retrieve information directly from the latest docs. Coding agents will be able to consult the latest documentation when performing coding tasks, and chatbots will be able to accurately answer questions about Astro features, APIs, and best practices.

Remember

The Astro Docs MCP server provides access to current documentation, but your AI tools are still responsible for interpretation and code generation. AI makes mistakes, so always review generated code carefully and test thoroughly.

### Troubleshooting

[Section titled “Troubleshooting”](#troubleshooting)

If you encounter issues:

* Verify that your tool supports streamable HTTP transport.
* Check that the server URL is correct: `https://mcp.docs.astro.build/mcp`.
* Ensure your tool has proper internet access.
* Consult your specific tool’s MCP integration documentation.

If you are still having problems, open an issue in the [Astro Docs MCP Server repository](https://github.com/withastro/docs-mcp/issues).

## Discord AI Support

[Section titled “Discord AI Support”](#discord-ai-support)

The same technology that powers Astro’s MCP server is also available as a chatbot in the [Astro Discord](https://astro.build/chat) for self-serve support. Visit the `#support-ai` channel to ask questions about Astro or your project code in natural language. Your conversation is automatically threaded, and you can ask an unlimited number of follow-up questions.

**Conversations with the chatbot are public, and are subject to the same server rules for language and behavior as the rest of our channels**, but they are not actively visited by our volunteer support members. For assistance from the community, please create a thread in our regular `#support` channel.

## Tips for AI-Powered Astro Development

[Section titled “Tips for AI-Powered Astro Development”](#tips-for-ai-powered-astro-development)

* **Start with templates**: Rather than building from scratch, ask AI tools to start with an existing [Astro template](https://astro.build/themes/) or use `npm create astro@latest` with a template option.
* **Use `astro add` for integrations**: Ask AI tools to use `astro add` for official integrations (e.g. `astro add tailwind`, `astro add react`). For other packages, install using the command for your preferred package manager rather than editing `package.json` directly.
* **Verify current APIs**: AI tools may use outdated patterns. Ask them to check the latest documentation, especially for newer features like sessions and actions. This is also important for features that have seen significant changes since their initial launch, such as content collections, or previously experimental features that may no longer be experimental.
* **Use project rules**: If your AI tool supports it, set up project rules to enforce best practices and coding standards, such as the ones listed above.
