## What went wrong?

[Section titled “What went wrong?”](#what-went-wrong)

Astro could not find an image you included in your Markdown content. Usually, this is simply caused by a typo in the path.

Images in Markdown are relative to the current file. To refer to an image that is located in the same folder as the `.md` file, the path should start with `./`
