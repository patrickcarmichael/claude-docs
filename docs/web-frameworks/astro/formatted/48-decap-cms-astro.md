# Decap CMS & Astro

> Add content to your Astro project using Decap as a CMS

[Decap CMS](https://www.decapcms.org/) (formerly Netlify CMS) is an open-source, Git-based content management system.

Decap allows you to take full advantage of all of Astro’s features, including image optimization and content collections.

Decap adds a route (typically `/admin`) to your project that will load a React app to allow authorized users to manage content directly from the deployed website. Decap will commit changes directly to your Astro project’s source repository.

## Installing DecapCMS

[Section titled “Installing DecapCMS”](#installing-decapcms)

There are two options for adding Decap to Astro:

1. [Install Decap via a package manager](https://decapcms.org/docs/install-decap-cms/#installing-with-npm) with the following command:

   * npm

     ```shell
     npm install decap-cms-app
     ```jsx
   * pnpm

     ```shell
     pnpm add decap-cms-app
     ```jsx
   * Yarn

     ```shell
     yarn add decap-cms-app
     ```jsx
2. Import the package into a `<script>` tag in your page `<body>`

   /admin

   ```html
   <body>
     <!-- Include the script that builds the page and powers Decap CMS -->
     <script src="https://unpkg.com/decap-cms@^3.1.2/dist/decap-cms.js"></script>
   </body>
   ```jsx
## Configuration

[Section titled “Configuration”](#configuration)

1. Create a static admin folder at `public/admin/`

2. Add `config.yml` to `public/admin/`:

   * public

     * admin

       * config.yml

3. To add support for content collections, configure each schema in `config.yml`. The following example configures a `blog` collection, defining a `label` for each entry’s frontmatter property:

   /public/admin/config.yml

   ```yml
   collections:
     - name: "blog" # Used in routes, e.g., /admin/collections/blog
       label: "Blog" # Used in the UI
       folder: "src/content/blog" # The path to the folder where the documents are stored
       create: true # Allow users to create new documents in this collection
       fields: # The fields for each document, usually in frontmatter
         - { label: "Layout", name: "layout", widget: "hidden", default: "blog" }
         - { label: "Title", name: "title", widget: "string" }
         - { label: "Publish Date", name: "date", widget: "datetime" }
         - { label: "Featured Image", name: "thumbnail", widget: "image" }
         - { label: "Rating (scale of 1-5)", name: "rating", widget: "number" }
         - { label: "Body", name: "body", widget: "markdown" }
   ```jsx
4. Add the `admin` route for your React app in `src/pages/admin.html`.

   * public

     * admin

       * config.yml

   * src

     * pages

       * admin.html

   /src/pages/admin.html

   ```html
   <!doctype html>
   <html lang="en">
     <head>
       <meta charset="utf-8" />
       <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
       <meta name="robots" content="noindex" />
       <link href="/admin/config.yml" type="text/yaml" rel="cms-config-url" />
       <title>Content Manager</title>
     </head>
     <body>
       <script src="https://unpkg.com/decap-cms@^3.1.2/dist/decap-cms.js"></script>
     </body>
   </html>
   ```jsx
5. To enable media uploads to a specific folder via the Decap editor, add an appropriate path:

   /public/admin/config.yml

   ```yml
   media_folder: "src/assets/images" # Location where files will be stored in the repo
   public_folder: "src/assets/images" # The src attribute for uploaded media
   ```jsx
See [the Decap CMS configuration documentation](https://decapcms.org/docs/configure-decap-cms/) for full instructions and options.

## Usage

[Section titled “Usage”](#usage)

## Authentication

[Section titled “Authentication”](#authentication)

### Decap CMS with Netlify Identity

[Section titled “Decap CMS with Netlify Identity”](#decap-cms-with-netlify-identity)

Decap CMS was originally developed by Netlify and has first class support for [Netlify Identity](https://docs.netlify.com/security/secure-access-to-sites/identity/).

When deploying to Netlify, configure Identity for your project via the Netlify dashboard and include the [Netlify Identity Widget](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-identity-widget) on the `admin` route of your project. Optionally include the Identity Widget on the homepage of your site if you plan to invite new users via email.

### Decap CMS with External OAuth Clients

[Section titled “Decap CMS with External OAuth Clients”](#decap-cms-with-external-oauth-clients)

When deploying to hosting providers other than Netlify, you must create your own OAuth routes.

In Astro, this can be done with on-demand rendered routes in your project configured with [an adapter](/en/guides/on-demand-rendering/) enabled.

See [Decap’s OAuth Docs](https://decapcms.org/docs/external-oauth-clients/) for a list of compatible community-maintained OAuth clients.
