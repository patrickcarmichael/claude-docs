# Unknown Vite Error.

## What went wrong?

[Section titled “What went wrong?”](#what-went-wrong)

Vite encountered an unknown error while rendering your project. We unfortunately do not know what happened (or we would tell you!)

If you can reliably cause this error to happen, we’d appreciate if you could [open an issue](https://astro.build/issues/)
