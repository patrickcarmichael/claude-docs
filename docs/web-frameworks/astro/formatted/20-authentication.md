# Authentication

> An intro to authentication in Astro

Authentication and authorization are two security processes that manage access to your website or app. Authentication verifies a visitor’s identity, while authorization grants access to protected areas and resources.

Authentication allows you to customize areas of your site for logged-in individuals and provides the greatest protection for personal or private information. Authentication libraries (e.g. [Better Auth](https://better-auth.com/), [Clerk](https://clerk.com)) provide utilities for multiple authentication methods such as email sign-in and OAuth providers.

Tip

There is no official authentication solution for Astro, but you can find [community “auth” integrations](https://astro.build/integrations/?search=auth) in the integrations directory.

See how to [add authentication with Supabase](/en/guides/backend/supabase/#adding-authentication-with-supabase) or [add authentication with Firebase](/en/guides/backend/google-firebase/#adding-authentication-with-firebase) in our dedicated guides for these backend services.

## Better Auth

[Section titled “Better Auth”](#better-auth)

Better Auth is a framework-agnostic authentication (and authorization) framework for TypeScript. It provides a comprehensive set of features out of the box and includes a plugin ecosystem that simplifies adding advanced functionalities.

It supports Astro out of the box, and you can use it to add authentication to your astro project.

### Installation

[Section titled “Installation”](#installation)

* npm

  ```shell
  npm install better-auth
  ```jsx
* pnpm

  ```shell
  pnpm add better-auth
  ```jsx
* Yarn

  ```shell
  yarn add better-auth
  ```jsx
For detailed setup instructions, check out the [Better Auth Installation Guide](https://www.better-auth.com/docs/installation).

### Configuration

[Section titled “Configuration”](#configuration)

Configure your database table to store user data and your preferred authentication methods as described in the [Better Auth Installation Guide](https://www.better-auth.com/docs/installation#configure-database). Then, you’ll need to mount the Better Auth handler in your Astro project.

src/pages/api/auth/\[...all].ts

```ts
import { auth } from "../../../lib/auth"; // import your Better Auth instance
import type { APIRoute } from "astro";


export const prerender = false; // Not needed in 'server' mode


export const ALL: APIRoute = async (ctx) => {
  return auth.handler(ctx.request);
};
```jsx
Follow the [Better Auth Astro Guide](https://www.better-auth.com/docs/integrations/astro) to learn more.

### Usage

[Section titled “Usage”](#usage)

Better Auth offers a `createAuthClient` helper for various frameworks, including Vanilla JS, React, Vue, Svelte, and Solid.

For example, to create a client for React, import the helper from `'better-auth/react'`:

* React

  src/lib/auth-client.ts

  ```ts
  import { createAuthClient } from 'better-auth/react';


  export const authClient = createAuthClient();


  export const { signIn, signOut } = authClient;
  ```jsx
* Solid

  src/lib/auth-client.ts

  ```ts
  import { createAuthClient } from 'better-auth/solid';


  export const authClient = createAuthClient();


  export const { signIn, signOut } = authClient;
  ```jsx
* Svelte

  src/lib/auth-client.ts

  ```ts
  import { createAuthClient } from 'better-auth/svelte';


  export const authClient = createAuthClient();


  export const { signIn, signOut } = authClient;
  ```jsx
* Vue

  src/lib/auth-client.ts

  ```ts
  import { createAuthClient } from 'better-auth/vue';


  export const authClient = createAuthClient();


  export const { signIn, signOut } = authClient;
  ```jsx
Once your client is set up, you can use it to authenticate users in your Astro components or any framework-specific files. The following example adds the ability to log in or log out with your configured `signIn()` and `signOut()` functions.

src/pages/index.astro

```astro
---
import Layout from 'src/layouts/Base.astro';
---
<Layout>
  <button id="login">Login</button>
  <button id="logout">Logout</button>


  <script>
    const { signIn, signOut } = await import("./lib/auth-client")
    document.querySelector("#login").onclick = () => signIn.social({
      provider: "github",
      callbackURL: "/dashboard",
    })
    document.querySelector("#logout").onclick = () => signOut()
  </script>
</Layout>
```jsx
You can then use the `auth` object to get the user’s session data in your server-side code. The following example personalizes page content by displaying an authenticated user’s name:

src/pages/index.astro

```astro
---
import { auth } from "../../../lib/auth"; // import your Better Auth instance


export const prerender = false; // Not needed in 'server' mode


const session = await auth.api.getSession({
  headers: Astro.request.headers,
});
---


<p>{session.user?.name}</p>
```jsx
You can also use the `auth` object to protect your routes using middleware. The following example checks whether a user trying to access a logged-in dashboard route is authenticated, and redirects them to the home page if not.

src/middleware.ts

```ts
import { auth } from "../../../auth"; // import your Better Auth instance
import { defineMiddleware } from "astro:middleware";


export const onRequest = defineMiddleware(async (context, next) => {
  const isAuthed = await auth.api
    .getSession({
      headers: context.request.headers,
    })
  if (context.url.pathname === "/dashboard" && !isAuthed) {
    return context.redirect("/");
  }
  return next();
});
```jsx

## Clerk

[Section titled “Clerk”](#clerk)

Clerk is a complete suite of embeddable UIs, flexible APIs, and admin dashboards to authenticate and manage your users. An [official Clerk SDK for Astro](https://clerk.com/docs/references/astro/overview) is available.

### Installation

[Section titled “Installation”](#installation-1)

Install `@clerk/astro` using the package manager of your choice.

* npm

  ```shell
  npm install @clerk/astro
  ```jsx
* pnpm

  ```shell
  pnpm add @clerk/astro
  ```jsx
* Yarn

  ```shell
  yarn add @clerk/astro
  ```jsx
### Configuration

[Section titled “Configuration”](#configuration-1)

Follow [Clerk’s own Astro Quickstart guide](https://clerk.com/docs/quickstarts/astro) to set up Clerk integration and middleware in your Astro project.

### Usage

[Section titled “Usage”](#usage-1)

Clerk provides components that allow you to control the visibility of pages based on your user’s authentication state. Show logged out users a sign in button instead of the content available to users who are logged in:

src/pages/index.astro

```astro
---
import Layout from 'src/layouts/Base.astro';
import { SignedIn, SignedOut, UserButton, SignInButton } from '@clerk/astro/components';


export const prerender = false; // Not needed in 'server' mode
---


<Layout>
    <SignedIn>
        <UserButton />
    </SignedIn>
    <SignedOut>
        <SignInButton />
    </SignedOut>
</Layout>
```jsx
Clerk also allows you to protect routes on the server using middleware. Specify which routes are protected, and prompt unauthenticated users to sign in:

src/middleware.ts

```ts
import { clerkMiddleware, createRouteMatcher } from '@clerk/astro/server';


const isProtectedRoute = createRouteMatcher([
  '/dashboard(.*)',
  '/forum(.*)',
]);


export const onRequest = clerkMiddleware((auth, context) => {
  if (!auth().userId && isProtectedRoute(context.request)) {
    return auth().redirectToSignIn();
  }
});
```jsx
### Next Steps

[Section titled “Next Steps”](#next-steps-1)

* Read the [official `@clerk/astro` documentation](https://clerk.com/docs/references/astro/overview)
* Start from a template with the [Clerk + Astro Quickstart project](https://github.com/clerk/clerk-astro-quickstart)
