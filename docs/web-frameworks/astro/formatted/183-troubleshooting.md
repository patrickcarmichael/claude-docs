# Troubleshooting

> Need help? Stuck on something? We've got you covered.

Astro provides several different tools to help you troubleshoot and debug your code.

## Tips and tricks

[Section titled “Tips and tricks”](#tips-and-tricks)

### Debugging with `console.log()`

[Section titled “Debugging with console.log()”](#debugging-with-consolelog)

`console.log()` is a simple-but-popular method of debugging your Astro code. Where you write your `console.log()` statement will determine where your debugging output is printed:

```astro
---
console.log('Hi! I’m the server. This is logged in the terminal where Astro is running.');
---


<script>
console.log('Hi! I’m the client. This is logged in browser dev console.');
</script>
```jsx
A `console.log()` statement in Astro frontmatter will always output to the **terminal** running the Astro CLI. This is because Astro runs on the server, and never in the browser.

Code that is written or imported inside of an Astro `<script>` tag is run in the browser. Any `console.log()` statements or other debug output will be printed to the **console in your browser**.

### Debugging framework components

[Section titled “Debugging framework components”](#debugging-framework-components)

[Framework components](/en/guides/framework-components/) (like React and Svelte) are unique: They render server-side by default, meaning that `console.log()` debug output will be visible in the terminal. However, they can also be hydrated for the browser, which may cause your debug logs to also appear in the browser.

This can be useful for debugging differences between the server output and the hydrated components in the browser.

### Astro `<Debug />` component

[Section titled “Astro \<Debug /> component”](#astro-debug--component)

To help you debug your Astro components, Astro provides a built-in `<Debug />` component which renders any value directly into your component HTML template.

This component provides a way to inspect values on the client-side, without any JavaScript. It can be useful for quick debugging in the browser without having to flip back-and-forth between your terminal and your browser.

```astro
---
import { Debug } from 'astro:components';
const sum = (a, b) => a + b;
---


<!-- Example: Outputs {answer: 6} to the browser -->
<Debug answer={sum(2, 4)} />
```jsx
The Debug component supports a variety of syntax options for even more flexible and concise debugging:

```astro
---
import { Debug } from 'astro:components';
const sum = (a, b) => a + b;
const answer = sum(2, 4);
---
<!-- Example: All three examples are equivalent. -->
<Debug answer={sum(2, 4)} />
<Debug {{answer: sum(2, 4)}} />
<Debug {answer} />
```jsx
## Common Error Messages

[Section titled “Common Error Messages”](#common-error-messages)

Here are some common error messages you might see in the terminal, what they might mean, and what to do about them. See our [full error reference guide](/en/reference/error-reference/) for a complete list of Astro errors you may encounter.

### Cannot use import statement outside a module

[Section titled “Cannot use import statement outside a module”](#cannot-use-import-statement-outside-a-module)

In Astro components, `<script>` tags are loaded as [JS modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules) by default. If you have included the [`is:inline` directive](/en/reference/directives-reference/#isinline) or any other attribute in your tag, this default behavior is removed.

**Solution**: If you have added any attributes to your `<script>` tag, you must also add the `type="module"` attribute to be able to use import statements.

**Status**: Expected Astro behavior, as intended.

**Not sure that this is your problem?**\
Check to see if anyone else has reported [this issue](https://github.com/withastro/astro/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+Cannot+use+import+statement)!

### `document` (or `window`) is not defined

[Section titled “document (or window) is not defined”](#document-or-window-is-not-defined)

This error occurs when trying to access `document` or `window` on the server.

Astro components run on the server, so you can’t access these browser-specific objects within the frontmatter.

Framework components run on the server by default, so this error can occur when accessing `document` or `window` during rendering.

**Solution**: Determine the code that calls `document` or `window`. If you aren’t using `document` or `window` directly and still getting this error, check to see if any packages you’re importing are meant to run on the client.

* If the code is in an Astro component, move it to a `<script>` tag outside of the frontmatter. This tells Astro to run this code on the client, where `document` and `window` are available.

* If the code is in a framework component, try to access these objects after rendering using lifecycle methods (e.g. [`useEffect()`](https://react.dev/reference/react/useEffect) in React, [`onMounted()`](https://vuejs.org/api/composition-api-lifecycle.html#onmounted) in Vue, and [`onMount()`](https://svelte.dev/docs#run-time-svelte-onmount) in Svelte). Tell the framework component to hydrate client-side by using a [client:](/en/reference/directives-reference/#client-directives) directive, like `client:load`, to run these lifecycle methods. You can also prevent the component from rendering on the server at all by adding the [`client:only`](/en/reference/directives-reference/#clientonly) directive.

**Status**: Expected Astro behavior, as intended.

### Expected a default export

[Section titled “Expected a default export”](#expected-a-default-export)

This error can be thrown when trying to import or render an invalid component, or one that is not working properly. (This particular message occurs because of the way importing a UI component works in Astro.)

**Solution**: Try looking for errors in any component you are importing and rendering, and make sure it’s working correctly. Consider opening an Astro starter template from [astro.new](https://astro.new) and troubleshooting just your component in a minimal Astro project.

**Status**: Expected Astro behavior, as intended.

### Refused to execute inline script

[Section titled “Refused to execute inline script”](#refused-to-execute-inline-script)

You may see the following error logged in the browser console:

> Refused to execute inline script because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: …

This means that your site’s [Content Security Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) (CSP) disallows running inline `<script>` tags, which Astro outputs by default.

**Solution:** Update your CSP to include `script-src: 'unsafe-inline'` to allow inline scripts to run. Alternatively, you can use a third-party integration such as [`astro-shield`](https://github.com/KindSpells/astro-shield) to generate the CSP headers for you.

## Common gotchas

[Section titled “Common gotchas”](#common-gotchas)

### My component is not rendering

[Section titled “My component is not rendering”](#my-component-is-not-rendering)

First, check to see that you have **imported the component** in your [`.astro` component script](/en/basics/astro-components/#the-component-script) or [`.mdx` file](/en/guides/integrations-guide/mdx/#using-components-in-mdx).

Then check your import statement:

* Is your import linking to the wrong place? (Check your import path.)

* Does your import have the same name as the imported component? (Check your component name and that it [follows the `.astro` syntax](/en/reference/astro-syntax/#differences-between-astro-and-jsx).)

* Have you included the extension in the import? (Check that your imported file contains an extension. e.g. `.astro`, `.md`, `.vue`, `.svelte`. Note: File extensions are **not** required for `.js(x)` and `.ts(x)` files only.)

### My component is not interactive

[Section titled “My component is not interactive”](#my-component-is-not-interactive)

If your component is rendering (see above) but is not responding to user interaction, then you may be missing a [`client:*` directive](/en/reference/directives-reference/#client-directives) to hydrate your component.

By default, a [UI Framework component is not hydrated in the client](/en/guides/framework-components/#hydrating-interactive-components). If no `client:*` directive is provided, its HTML is rendered onto the page without JavaScript.

Tip

[Astro components](/en/basics/astro-components/) are HTML-only templating components with no client-side runtime. But, you can use a `<script>` tag in your Astro component template to send JavaScript to the browser that executes in the global scope.

### Cannot find package ‘X’

[Section titled “Cannot find package ‘X’”](#cannot-find-package-x)

If you see a `"Cannot find package 'react'"` (or similar) warning when you start up Astro, that means that you need to install that package into your project. Not all package managers will install peer dependencies for you automatically. If you are on Node v16+ and using npm, you should not need to worry about this section.

React, for example, is a peer dependency of the `@astrojs/react` integration. That means that you should install the official `react` and `react-dom` packages alongside your integration. The integration will then pull from these packages automatically.
