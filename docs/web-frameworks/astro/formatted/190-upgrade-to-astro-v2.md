## Astro v2.0 Breaking Changes

[Section titled “Astro v2.0 Breaking Changes”](#astro-v20-breaking-changes)

Astro v2.0 includes some breaking changes, as well as the removal of some previously deprecated features. If your project doesn’t work as expected after upgrading to v2.0, check this guide for an overview of all breaking changes and instructions on how to update your codebase.

See [the changelog](https://github.com/withastro/astro/blob/main/packages/astro/CHANGELOG.md) for full release notes.

### Removed: Support for Node 14

[Section titled “Removed: Support for Node 14”](#removed-support-for-node-14)

Node 14 is scheduled to reach its End of Life in April 2023.

Astro v2.0 drops Node 14 support entirely, so that all Astro users can take advantage of Node’s more modern features.

#### What should I do?

[Section titled “What should I do?”](#what-should-i-do)

Check that both your development environment and your deployment environment are using **Node `16.12.0` or later**.

1. Check your local version of Node using:

   ```sh
   node -v
   ```jsx
   If your local development environment needs upgrading, [install Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

2. Check your [deployment environment’s](/en/guides/deploy/) own documentation to verify that they support Node 16.

   You can specify Node `16.12.0` for your Astro project either in a dashboard configuration setting, or a `.nvmrc` file.

### Reserved: `src/content/`

[Section titled “Reserved: src/content/”](#reserved-srccontent)

Astro v2.0 now includes the Collections API for organizing your Markdown and MDX files into [content collections](/en/guides/content-collections/). This API reserves `src/content/` as a special folder.

#### What should I do?

[Section titled “What should I do?”](#what-should-i-do-1)

Rename an existing `src/content/` folder to avoid conflicts. This folder, if it exists, can now only be used for [content collections](/en/guides/content-collections/).

### Changed: `Astro.site` trailing slash

[Section titled “Changed: Astro.site trailing slash”](#changed-astrosite-trailing-slash)

In v1.x, Astro ensured the URL you set as `site` in `astro.config.mjs` always had a trailing slash when accessed using `Astro.site`.

Astro v2.0 no longer modifies the value of `site`. `Astro.site` will use the exact value defined, and a trailing slash must be specified if desired.

#### What should I do?

[Section titled “What should I do?”](#what-should-i-do-2)

In `astro.config.mjs`, add a trailing slash to the URL set in `site`.

astro.config.mjs

```diff
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';


export default defineConfig({
-  site: 'https://example.com',
+  site: 'https://example.com/',
});
```jsx
### Changed: `_astro/` folder for build assets

[Section titled “Changed: \_astro/ folder for build assets”](#changed-_astro-folder-for-build-assets)

In v1.x, assets were built to various locations, including `assets/`, `chunks/`, and to the root of the build output.

Astro v2.0 moves and unifies the location of all build output assets to a new `_astro/` folder.

* dist/

  * \_astro

    * client.9218e799.js
    * index.df3f880e0.css

You can control this location with the [new `build.assets` configuration option](/en/reference/configuration-reference/#buildassets).

#### What should I do?

[Section titled “What should I do?”](#what-should-i-do-3)

Update your deployment platform configuration if it relies on the location of these assets.

### Changed: Markdown plugin configuration

[Section titled “Changed: Markdown plugin configuration”](#changed-markdown-plugin-configuration)

#### Removed: `extendDefaultPlugins`

[Section titled “Removed: extendDefaultPlugins”](#removed-extenddefaultplugins)

In v1.x, Astro used `markdown.extendDefaultPlugins` to re-enable Astro’s default plugins when adding your own Markdown plugins.

Astro v2.0 removes this configuration option entirely because its behavior is now the default.

Applying remark and rehype plugins in your Markdown configuration **no longer disables Astro’s default plugins**. GitHub-Flavored Markdown and Smartypants are now applied whether or not custom `remarkPlugins` or `rehypePlugins` are configured.

##### What should I do?

[Section titled “What should I do?”](#what-should-i-do-4)

Remove `extendDefaultPlugins` in your configuration. This is now Astro’s default behavior in v2.0, and you can delete this line without any replacement.

astro.config.mjs

```diff
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';


export default defineConfig({
  markdown: {
-    extendDefaultPlugins,
  }
});
```jsx
#### Added: `gfm` and `smartypants`

[Section titled “Added: gfm and smartypants”](#added-gfm-and-smartypants)

In v1.x, you could choose to disable both of Astro’s default Markdown plugins (GitHub-Flavored Markdown and SmartyPants) by setting `markdown.extendDefaultPlugins: false`.

Astro v2.0 replaces `markdown.extendDefaultPlugins: false` with separate Boolean options to individually control each of Astro’s built-in default Markdown plugins. These are enabled by default and can be set to `false` independently.

##### What should I do?

[Section titled “What should I do?”](#what-should-i-do-5)

Remove `extendDefaultPlugins: false` and add the flags to disable each plugin individually instead.

* `markdown.gfm: false` disables GitHub-Flavored Markdown
* `markdown.smartypants: false` disables SmartyPants

astro.config.mjs

```diff
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';


export default defineConfig({
  markdown: {
-    extendDefaultPlugins: false,
+    smartypants: false,
+    gfm: false,
  }
});
```jsx
### Changed: MDX plugin configuration

[Section titled “Changed: MDX plugin configuration”](#changed-mdx-plugin-configuration)

#### Replaced: `extendPlugins` changed to `extendMarkdownConfig`

[Section titled “Replaced: extendPlugins changed to extendMarkdownConfig”](#replaced-extendplugins-changed-to-extendmarkdownconfig)

In v1.x, the MDX integration’s `extendPlugins` option managed how your MDX files should inherit your Markdown configuration: all your Markdown configuration (`markdown`), or Astro’s default plugins only (`default`).

Astro v2.0 replaces the behavior controlled by `mdx.extendPlugins` with three new, independently-configurable options that are `true` by default:

* **[`mdx.extendMarkdownConfig`](/en/guides/integrations-guide/mdx/#extendmarkdownconfig)** to inherit all or none of your Markdown configuration
* **`mdx.gfm`** to enable or disable GitHub-Flavored Markdown in MDX
* **`mdx.smartypants`** to enable or disable SmartyPants in MDX

##### What should I do?

[Section titled “What should I do?”](#what-should-i-do-6)

Delete `extendPlugins: 'markdown'` in your configuration. This is now the default behavior.

astro.config.mjs

```diff
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
import mdx from '@astrojs/mdx';


export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [
    mdx({
-      extendPlugins: 'markdown',
    }),
  ],
});
```jsx
Replace `extendPlugins: 'defaults'` with `extendMarkdownConfig: false` and add the separate options for GitHub-Flavored Markdown and SmartyPants to enable these default plugins individually in MDX.

astro.config.mjs

```diff
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
import mdx from '@astrojs/mdx';


export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [
    mdx({
-      extendPlugins: 'defaults',
+      extendMarkdownConfig: false,
+      smartypants: true,
+      gfm: true,
    }),
  ],
});
```jsx
#### Added: More MDX config options to match Markdown

[Section titled “Added: More MDX config options to match Markdown”](#added-more-mdx-config-options-to-match-markdown)

Astro v2.0 allows you to now individually set [every available Markdown configuration option](/en/reference/configuration-reference/#markdown-options) (except `drafts`) separately in your MDX integration configuration.

astro.config.mjs

```js
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
import mdx from '@astrojs/mdx';


export default defineConfig({
  markdown: {
    remarkPlugins: [remarkPlugin1],
    gfm: true,
  },
  integrations: [
    mdx({
      remarkPlugins: [remarkPlugin2],
      gfm: false,
    })
  ]
});
```jsx
##### What should I do?

[Section titled “What should I do?”](#what-should-i-do-7)

Revisit your Markdown and MDX configuration and compare your existing config with the new options available.

### Changed: Plugin access to frontmatter

[Section titled “Changed: Plugin access to frontmatter”](#changed-plugin-access-to-frontmatter)

In v1.x, remark and rehype plugins did not have access to user frontmatter. Astro merged plugin frontmatter with your file’s frontmatter, without passing the file frontmatter to your plugins.

Astro v2.0 gives remark and rehype plugins access to user frontmatter via frontmatter injection. This allows plugin authors to modify a user’s existing frontmatter, or compute new properties based on other properties.

#### What should I do?

[Section titled “What should I do?”](#what-should-i-do-8)

Check any remark and rehype plugins you have written to see whether their behavior has changed. Note that `data.astro.frontmatter` is now the *complete* Markdown or MDX document’s frontmatter, rather than an empty object.

### Changed: RSS Configuration

[Section titled “Changed: RSS Configuration”](#changed-rss-configuration)

In v1.x, Astro’s RSS package allowed you to use `items: import.meta.glob(...)` to generate a list of RSS feed items. This usage is now deprecated and will eventually be removed.

Astro v2.0 introduces a `pagesGlobToRssItems()` wrapper to the `items` property.

#### What should I do?

[Section titled “What should I do?”](#what-should-i-do-9)

Import, then wrap your existing function containing `import.meta.glob()` with the `pagesGlobToRssItems()` helper.

src/pages/rss.xml.js

```diff
import rss, {
+  pagesGlobToRssItems
} from '@astrojs/rss';


export async function get(context) {
  return rss({
+    items: await pagesGlobToRssItems(
      import.meta.glob('./blog/*.{md,mdx}'),
+    ),
  });
}
```jsx
### Changed: Svelte IDE support

[Section titled “Changed: Svelte IDE support”](#changed-svelte-ide-support)

Astro v2.0 requires a `svelte.config.js` file in your project if you are using [the `@astrojs/svelte` integration](/en/guides/integrations-guide/svelte/). This is needed to provide IDE autocompletion.

#### What should I do?

[Section titled “What should I do?”](#what-should-i-do-10)

Add a `svelte.config.js` file to the root of your project:

svelte.config.js

```js
import { vitePreprocess } from '@astrojs/svelte';


export default {
  preprocess: vitePreprocess(),
};
```jsx
For new users, this file will be added automatically when running `astro add svelte`.

### Removed: `legacy.astroFlavoredMarkdown`

[Section titled “Removed: legacy.astroFlavoredMarkdown”](#removed-legacyastroflavoredmarkdown)

In v1.0, Astro moved the old Astro-Flavored Markdown (also known as Components in Markdown) to a legacy feature.

Astro v2.0 removes the `legacy.astroFlavoredMarkdown` option completely. Importing and using components in `.md` files will no longer work.

#### What should I do?

[Section titled “What should I do?”](#what-should-i-do-11)

Remove this legacy flag. It is no longer available in Astro.

astro.config.mjs

```diff
export default defineConfig({
-  legacy: {
-    astroFlavoredMarkdown: true,
-  },
})
```jsx
If you were using this feature in v1.x, we recommend [using the MDX integration](/en/guides/integrations-guide/mdx/) which allows you to combine components and JSX expressions with Markdown syntax.

### Removed: `Astro.resolve()`

[Section titled “Removed: Astro.resolve()”](#removed-astroresolve)

In v0.24, Astro deprecated `Astro.resolve()` for getting resolved URLs to assets that you might want to reference in the browser.

Astro v2.0 removes this option entirely. `Astro.resolve()` in your code will cause an error.

#### What should I do?

[Section titled “What should I do?”](#what-should-i-do-12)

Resolve asset paths using `import` instead. For example:

src/pages/index.astro

```astro
---
import 'style.css';
import imageUrl from './image.png';
---


<img src={imageUrl} />
```jsx
### Removed: `Astro.fetchContent()`

[Section titled “Removed: Astro.fetchContent()”](#removed-astrofetchcontent)

In v0.26, Astro deprecated `Astro.fetchContent()` for fetching data from your local Markdown files.

Astro v2.0 removes this option entirely. `Astro.fetchContent()` in your code will cause an error.

#### What should I do?

[Section titled “What should I do?”](#what-should-i-do-13)

Use `Astro.glob()` to fetch Markdown files, or convert to the [Content Collections](/en/guides/content-collections/) feature.

src/pages/index.astro

```astro
---
const allPosts = await Astro.glob('./posts/*.md');
---
```jsx
### Removed: `Astro.canonicalURL`

[Section titled “Removed: Astro.canonicalURL”](#removed-astrocanonicalurl)

In v1.0, Astro deprecated `Astro.canonicalURL` for constructing a canonical URL.

Astro v2.0 removes this option entirely. `Astro.canonicalURL` in your code will cause an error.

#### What should I do?

[Section titled “What should I do?”](#what-should-i-do-14)

Use `Astro.url` to construct a canonical URL.

src/pages/index.astro

```astro
---
const canonicalURL = new URL(Astro.url.pathname, Astro.site);
---
```jsx
### Updated: Vite 4

[Section titled “Updated: Vite 4”](#updated-vite-4)

Astro v2.0 upgrades from Vite 3 to [Vite 4](https://vite.dev/), released in December 2022.

#### What should I do?

[Section titled “What should I do?”](#what-should-i-do-15)

There should be no changes to your code necessary! We’ve handled most of the upgrade for you inside of Astro; however, some subtle Vite behaviors may still change between versions.

Refer to the official [Vite Migration Guide](https://vite.dev/guide/migration.html) if you run into trouble.

## Astro v2.0 Experimental Flags Removed

[Section titled “Astro v2.0 Experimental Flags Removed”](#astro-v20-experimental-flags-removed)

Remove the following experimental flags from `astro.config.mjs`:

astro.config.mjs

```diff
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';


export default defineConfig({
-  experimental: {
-    contentCollections: true,
-    prerender: true,
-    errorOverlay: true,
-  },
})
```jsx
These features are now available by default:

* [Content collections](/en/guides/content-collections/) as a way to manage your Markdown and MDX files with type-safety.
* [Prerendering individual pages to static HTML](/en/guides/on-demand-rendering/) when using SSR to improve speed and cacheability.
* A redesigned error message overlay.

## Known Issues

[Section titled “Known Issues”](#known-issues)
