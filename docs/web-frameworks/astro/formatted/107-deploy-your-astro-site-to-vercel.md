# Deploy your Astro Site to Vercel

> How to deploy your Astro site to the web on Vercel.

You can use [Vercel](http://vercel.com/) to deploy an Astro site to their global edge network with zero configuration.

This guide includes instructions for deploying to Vercel through the website UI or Vercel’s CLI.

## Project configuration

[Section titled “Project configuration”](#project-configuration)

Your Astro project can be deployed to Vercel as a static site, or a server-rendered site.

### Static site

[Section titled “Static site”](#static-site)

Your Astro project is a static site by default. You don’t need any extra configuration to deploy a static Astro site to Vercel.

### Adapter for on-demand rendering

[Section titled “Adapter for on-demand rendering”](#adapter-for-on-demand-rendering)

Add [the Vercel adapter](/en/guides/integrations-guide/vercel/) to enable [on-demand rendering](/en/guides/on-demand-rendering/) in your Astro project with the following `astro add` command. This will install the adapter and make the appropriate changes to your `astro.config.mjs` file in one step.

* npm

  ```shell
  npx astro add vercel
  ```jsx
* pnpm

  ```shell
  pnpm astro add vercel
  ```jsx
* Yarn

  ```shell
  yarn astro add vercel
  ```jsx
See the [Vercel adapter guide](/en/guides/integrations-guide/vercel/) to install manually instead, or for more configuration options, such as deploying your project’s Astro middleware using Vercel Edge Functions.

## How to deploy

[Section titled “How to deploy”](#how-to-deploy)

You can deploy to Vercel through the website UI or using Vercel’s CLI (command line interface). The process is the same for both static and on-demand rendered Astro sites.

### Website UI deployment

[Section titled “Website UI deployment”](#website-ui-deployment)

1. Push your code to your online Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket).

2. [Import your project](https://vercel.com/new) into Vercel.

3. Vercel will automatically detect Astro and configure the right settings.

4. Your application is deployed! (e.g. [astro.vercel.app](https://astro.vercel.app/))

After your project has been imported and deployed, all subsequent pushes to branches will generate [Preview Deployments](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/deployments/preview-deployments), and all changes made to the Production Branch (commonly “main”) will result in a [Production Deployment](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/deployments/environments#production).

Learn more about Vercel’s [Git Integration](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/git).

### CLI deployment

[Section titled “CLI deployment”](#cli-deployment)

1. Install the [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/cli) and run `vercel` to deploy.

   * npm

     ```shell
     npm install -g vercel
     vercel
     ```jsx
   * pnpm

     ```shell
     pnpm add -g vercel
     vercel
     ```jsx
   * Yarn

     ```shell
     yarn global add vercel
     vercel
     ```jsx
2. Vercel will automatically detect Astro and configure the right settings.

3. When asked `Want to override the settings? [y/N]`, choose `N`.

4. Your application is deployed! (e.g. [astro.vercel.app](https://astro.vercel.app/))

### Project config with `vercel.json`

[Section titled “Project config with vercel.json”](#project-config-with-verceljson)

You can use `vercel.json` to override the default behavior of Vercel and to configure additional settings. For example, you may wish to attach headers to HTTP responses from your Deployments.
