# Middleware API Reference

**Added in:** `astro@2.6.0`

Middleware allows you to intercept requests and responses and inject behaviors dynamically every time a page or endpoint is about to be rendered. For features and usage examples, [see our middleware guide](/en/guides/middleware/).

## Imports from `astro:middleware`

[Section titled “Imports from astro:middleware”](#imports-from-astromiddleware)

```js
import {
  sequence,
  createContext,
  trySerializeLocals,
  defineMiddleware,
 } from 'astro:middleware';
```jsx
### `defineMiddleware()`

[Section titled “defineMiddleware()”](#definemiddleware)

You can import and use the utility function `defineMiddleware()` to take advantage of type safety:

src/middleware.ts

```ts
import { defineMiddleware } from "astro:middleware";


// `context` and `next` are automatically typed
export const onRequest = defineMiddleware((context, next) => {


});
```jsx
### `sequence()`

[Section titled “sequence()”](#sequence)

**Type:** `(...handlers: MiddlewareHandler[]) => MiddlewareHandler`

A function that accepts middleware functions as arguments, and will execute them in the order in which they are passed.

src/middleware.js

```js
import { sequence } from "astro:middleware";


async function validation(_, next) {...}
async function auth(_, next) {...}
async function greeting(_, next) {...}


export const onRequest = sequence(validation, auth, greeting);
```jsx
### `createContext()`

[Section titled “createContext()”](#createcontext)

**Type:** `(context: CreateContext) => APIContext`

**Added in:** `astro@2.8.0`

A low-level API to create an [`APIContext`](/en/reference/api-reference/)to be passed to an Astro middleware `onRequest()` function.

This function can be used by integrations/adapters to programmatically execute the Astro middleware.

### `trySerializeLocals()`

[Section titled “trySerializeLocals()”](#tryserializelocals)

**Type:** `(value: unknown) => string`

**Added in:** `astro@2.8.0`

A low-level API that takes in any value and tries to return a serialized version (a string) of it. If the value cannot be serialized, the function will throw a runtime error.

## Middleware exports

[Section titled “Middleware exports”](#middleware-exports)

When defining your project’s middleware in `src/middleware.js`, export the following user-defined functions:

### `onRequest()`

[Section titled “onRequest()”](#onrequest)

**Type:** `(context: APIContext, next: MiddlewareNext) => Promise<Response> | Response | Promise<void> | void`

A required exported function from `src/middleware.js` that will be called before rendering every page or API route. It receives two arguments: [context](#context) and [next()](#next). `onRequest()` must return a `Response`: either directly, or by calling `next()`.

src/middleware.js

```js
export function onRequest (context, next) {
    // intercept response data from a request
    // optionally, transform the response
    // return a Response directly, or the result of calling `next()`
    return next();
};
```jsx
Your `onRequest()` function will be called with the following arguments:

#### `context`

[Section titled “context”](#context)

**Type:** `APIContext`

The first argument of `onRequest()` is a context object. It mirrors many of the `Astro` global properties.

See [Endpoint contexts](/en/reference/api-reference/) for more information about the context object.

#### `next()`

[Section titled “next()”](#next)

**Type:** `(rewritePayload?: string | URL | Request) => Promise<Response>`

The second argument of `onRequest()` is a function that calls all the subsequent middleware in the chain and returns a `Response`. For example, other middleware could modify the HTML body of a response and awaiting the result of `next()` would allow your middleware to respond to those changes.

Since Astro v4.13.0, `next()` accepts an optional URL path parameter in the form of a string, `URL`, or `Request` to [rewrite](/en/guides/routing/#rewrites) the current request without retriggering a new rendering phase.
