# Vercel Integrations

Copy page

Ask AI about this page

Last updated July 22, 2025

Integrations allow you to extend the capabilities of Vercel by connecting with third-party platforms or services to do things like:

*   Work with [storage](/docs/storage) products from third-party solutions
*   Connect with external [AI](/docs/ai) services
*   Send logs to services
*   Integrate with testing tools
*   Connect your CMS and ecommerce platform

To extend and automate your workflow, the [Vercel Marketplace](https://vercel.com/marketplace) page provides you with two types of integrations, depending on your needs:

*   [Native integrations](/docs/integrations#native-integrations)
*   [Connectable accounts](/docs/integrations#connectable-accounts)

## [Native integrations](#native-integrations)

Native integrations allow a two-way connection between Vercel and third-parties Vercel has partnered with. These native integrations provide the option to subscribe to products through the Vercel dashboard.

Native integrations provide the following benefits:

*   You don't have to create an account on the integration provider's site.
*   For each available product, you can choose the billing plan suitable for your needs through the Vercel dashboard.
*   The billing is managed through your Vercel account.

### [Get started with native integrations](#get-started-with-native-integrations)

As a Vercel customer:

*   [Extend your Vercel workflow](/docs/integrations/install-an-integration/product-integration): You can install an integration from the marketplace and add the product that fits your need.
*   View the [list of available native integrations](#native-integrations-list).
*   [Add an AI provider](/docs/ai/adding-a-provider): You can add a provider to your Vercel workflow.
*   [Add an AI model](/docs/ai/adding-a-model): You can add a model to your Vercel workflow.

As a Vercel provider:

*   [Integrate with Vercel](/docs/integrations/create-integration/native-integration): You can create an integration and make different products from your third-party service available for purchase to Vercel customers through the marketplace.

## [Connectable accounts](#connectable-accounts)

These integrations allow you to connect Vercel with an existing account on a third-party platform or service and provide you with features and environment variables that enable seamless integration with the third party.

When you add a connectable account integration through the Vercel dashboard, you are prompted to log in to your account on the third-party platform.

### [Get started with connectable account integrations](#get-started-with-connectable-account-integrations)

*   [Add a connectable account](/docs/integrations/install-an-integration/add-a-connectable-account): As a Vercel customer, you can integrate various tools into your Vercel workflow.
*   [Integrate with Vercel](/docs/integrations/create-integration): You can extend the Vercel platform through traditional integrations, guides, and templates that you can distribute privately, or host on the Vercel Marketplace
*   View the [list of available connectable account integrations](#connectable-account-integrations-list).

# Vercel CMS Integrations

Ask AI about this page

Last updated September 24, 2025

Vercel Content Management System (CMS) Integrations allow you to connect your projects with CMS platforms, including [Contentful](/docs/integrations/contentful), [Sanity](/integrations/sanity), [Sitecore XM Cloud](/docs/integrations/sitecore) and [more](#featured-cms-integrations). These integrations provide a direct path to incorporating CMS into your applications, enabling you to build, deploy, and leverage CMS-powered features with minimal hassle.

You can use the following methods to integrate your CMS with Vercel:

*   [Environment variable import](#environment-variable-import): Quickly setup your Vercel project with environment variables from your CMS
*   [Edit Mode through the Vercel Toolbar](#edit-mode-with-the-vercel-toolbar): Visualize content from your CMS within a Vercel deployments and edit directly in your CMS
    *   [Content Link](/docs/edit-mode#content-link): Lets you visualize content models from your CMS within a Vercel deployments and edit directly in your CMS
*   [Deploy changes from CMS](#deploy-changes-from-cms): Connect and deploy content from your CMS to your Vercel site

## [Environment variable import](#environment-variable-import)

The most common way to setup a CMS with Vercel is by installing an integration through the [Integrations Marketplace](https://vercel.com/integrations#cms). This method allows you to quickly setup your Vercel project with environment variables from your CMS.

Once a CMS has been installed, and a project linked you can pull in environment variables from the CMS to your Vercel project using the [Vercel CLI](/docs/cli/env).

1.  ### [Install the Vercel CLI](#install-the-vercel-cli)
    
    To pull in environment variables from your CMS to your Vercel project, you need to install the [Vercel CLI](/docs/cli). Run the following command in your terminal:
    
    pnpmyarnnpmbun
    
    ```
    pnpm i -g vercel@latest
    ```
    
2.  ### [Install your CMS integration](#install-your-cms-integration)
    
    Navigate to the CMS integration you want to install into your project, and follow the steps to install the integration.
    
3.  ### [Pull in environment variables](#pull-in-environment-variables)
    
    Once you've installed the CMS integration, you can pull in environment variables from the CMS to your Vercel project. In your terminal, run:
    
    ```
    vercel env pull
    ```
    

See your installed CMSs documentation for next steps on how to use the integration.

## [Edit mode with the Vercel Toolbar](#edit-mode-with-the-vercel-toolbar)

To access Edit Mode:

1.  Ensure you're logged into the [Vercel Toolbar](/docs/vercel-toolbar) with your Vercel account.
2.  Navigate to a page with editable content. The Edit Mode option will only appear in the [Vercel Toolbar](/docs/vercel-toolbar) menu when there are elements on the page matched to fields in the CMS.
3.  Select the Edit Mode option in the toolbar menu. This will highlight the editable fields as [Content Links](/docs/edit-mode#content-link), which turn blue as you hover near them.

The following CMS integrations support Content Link:

    ](https://strapi.io/blog/announcing-visual-editing-for-strapi-powered-by-vercel)

See the [Edit Mode documentation](/docs/edit-mode) for information on setup and configuration.

## [Draft mode through the Vercel Toolbar](#draft-mode-through-the-vercel-toolbar)

Draft mode allows you to view unpublished content from your CMS within a Vercel preview, and works with Next.js and SvelteKit. See the [Draft Mode documentation](/docs/draft-mode) for information and setup and configuration.

## [Deploy changes from CMS](#deploy-changes-from-cms)

This method is generally setup through webhooks or APIs that trigger a deployment when content is updated in the CMS. See your CMSs documentation for information on how to set this up.

[Contentful](https://contentful.com/) is a headless CMS that allows you to separate the content management and presentation layers of your web application. This integration allows you to deploy your content from Contentful to Vercel.

This quickstart guide uses the [Vercel Contentful integration](/integrations/contentful) to allow streamlined access between your Contentful content and Vercel deployment. When you use the template, you'll be automatically prompted to install the Integration during deployment.

If you already have a Vercel deployment and a Contentful account, you should [install the Contentful Integration](/integrations/contentful) to connect your Space to your Vercel project. To finish, the important parts that you need to know from the QuickStart are:

*   Getting your [Space ID](#retrieve-your-contentful-space-id) and [Content Management API Token](#create-a-content-management-api-token)
*   [Importing your content model](#import-the-content-model)
*   [Adding your Contentful environment variables](#add-environment-variables) to your Vercel project

To help you get started, we built a [template](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/nextjs-blog-preview-mode) using Next.js, Contentful, and Tailwind CSS.

You can either deploy the template above to Vercel with one click, or use the steps below to clone it to your machine and deploy it locally:

1.  ### [Clone the repository](#clone-the-repository)
    
    You can clone the repo using the following command:
    
    pnpmyarnnpmbun
    
    ```
    pnpm create-next-app --example cms-contentful
    ```
    
2.  ### [Create a Contentful Account](#create-a-contentful-account)
    
    Next, create a new account on [Contentful](https://contentful.com/) and make an empty "space". This is where your content lives. We also created a sample content model to help you get started quickly.
    
    If you have an existing account and space, you can use it with the rest of these steps.
    
3.  ### [Retrieve your Contentful Space ID](#retrieve-your-contentful-space-id)
    
    The Vercel integration uses your Contentful Space ID to communicate with Contentful. To find this, navigate to your Contentful dashboard and select Settings > API Keys. Click on Add API key and you will see your Space ID in the next screen.
    
    ![](/vc-ap-vercel-docs/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F7nyt0uhk7sse4zvn.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs-assets%2Fstatic%2Fdocs%2Fintegrations%2Fcontentful%2Fapi-section.png&w=2048&q=75)
    
4.  ### [Create a Content Management API token](#create-a-content-management-api-token)
    
    You will also need to create a Content Management API token for Vercel to communicate back and forth with the Contentful API. You can get that by going to Settings > API Keys > Content management tokens.
    
    ![](/vc-ap-vercel-docs/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F7nyt0uhk7sse4zvn.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs-assets%2Fstatic%2Fdocs%2Fintegrations%2Fcontentful%2Fcontent-management-tokens.png&w=1920&q=75)
    
    Click on Generate personal token and a modal will pop up. Give your token a name and click on Generate.
    
    Avoid sharing this token because it allows both read and write access to your Contentful space. Once the token is generated copy the key and save remotely as it will not be accessible later on. If lost, a new one must be created.
    
5.  ### [Import the Content Model](#import-the-content-model)
    
    Use your Space ID and Content Management Token in the command below to import the pre-made content model into your space using our setup Node.js script. You can do that by running the following command:
    
    pnpmyarnnpmbun
    
    ```
    npx cross-env CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID=YOUR_SPACE_ID CONTENTFUL_MANAGEMENT_TOKEN=XXX pnpm run setup
    ```
    

## [Adding Content in Contentful](#adding-content-in-contentful)

Now that you've created your space in Contentful, add some content!

1.  ### [Publish Contentful entries](#publish-contentful-entries)
    
    You'll notice the new author and post entries for the example we've provided. Publish each entry to make this fully live.
    
2.  ### [Retrieve your Contentful Secrets](#retrieve-your-contentful-secrets)
    
    Now, let's save the Space ID and token from earlier to add as Environment Variables for running locally. Create a new `.env.local` file in your application:
    
    terminal
    
    ```
    CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID='your-space-id'
    CONTENTFUL_ACCESS_TOKEN='your-content-api-token'
    ```
    
3.  ### [Start your application](#start-your-application)
    
    You can now start your application with the following comment:
    
    pnpmyarnnpmbun
    
    ```
    pnpm install && pnpm run dev
    ```
    
    Your project should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.
    

## [How it works](#how-it-works)

Next.js is designed to integrate with any data source of your choice, including Content Management Systems. Contentful provides a helpful GraphQL API, which you can both query and mutate data from. This allows you to decouple your content from your frontend. For example:

```
async function fetchGraphQL(query) {
  return fetch(
    `https://graphql.contentful.com/content/v1/repos/${process.env.CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID}`,
    {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.CONTENTFUL_ACCESS_TOKEN}`,
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({ query }),
    },
  ).then((response) => response.json());
}
```

This code allows you to fetch data on the server from your Contentful instance. Each space inside Contentful has its own ID (e.g. `CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID`) which you can add as an Environment Variable inside your Next.js application.

This allows you to use secure values you don't want to commit to git, which are only evaluated on the server (e.g. `CONTENTFUL_ACCESS_TOKEN`).

## [Deploying to Vercel](#deploying-to-vercel)

Now that you have your application wired up to Contentful, you can deploy it to Vercel to get your site online. You can either use the Vercel CLI or the Git integrations to deploy your code. Let’s use the Git integration.

1.  ### [Publish your code to Git](#publish-your-code-to-git)
    
    Push your code to your git repository (e.g. GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket).
    
    terminal
    
    ```
    git init
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    git remote add origin
    git push -u origin master
    ```
    
2.  ### [Import your project into Vercel](#import-your-project-into-vercel)
    
    Log in to your Vercel account (or create one) and import your project into Vercel using the [import flow](https://vercel.com/new).
    
    ![](/vc-ap-vercel-docs/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F7nyt0uhk7sse4zvn.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs-assets%2Fstatic%2Fdocs%2Fintegrations%2Fcontentful%2Fimport-to-vercel.png&w=3840&q=75)![](/vc-ap-vercel-docs/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F7nyt0uhk7sse4zvn.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs-assets%2Fstatic%2Fdocs%2Fintegrations%2Fcontentful%2Fimport-vercel-dark.png&w=3840&q=75)
    
    Vercel will detect that you are using Next.js and will enable the correct settings for your deployment.
    
3.  ### [Add Environment Variables](#add-environment-variables)
    
    Add the `CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID` and `CONTENTFUL_ACCESS_TOKEN` Environment Variables from your `.env.local` file by copying and pasting it under the Environment Variables section.
    
    terminal
    
    ```
    CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID='your-space-id'
    CONTENTFUL_ACCESS_TOKEN='your-content-api-token'
    ```
    
    ![](/vc-ap-vercel-docs/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F7nyt0uhk7sse4zvn.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs-assets%2Fstatic%2Fdocs%2Fintegrations%2Fcontentful%2Fadd-env-vars.png&w=3840&q=75)![](/vc-ap-vercel-docs/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F7nyt0uhk7sse4zvn.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs-assets%2Fstatic%2Fdocs%2Fintegrations%2Fcontentful%2Fadd-env-vars-dark.png&w=3840&q=75)
    
    Click "Deploy" and your application will be live on Vercel!
    
    ![](/vc-ap-vercel-docs/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F7nyt0uhk7sse4zvn.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs-assets%2Fstatic%2Fdocs%2Fintegrations%2Fcontentful%2Fdeployed.png&w=3840&q=75)![](/vc-ap-vercel-docs/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F7nyt0uhk7sse4zvn.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs-assets%2Fstatic%2Fdocs%2Fintegrations%2Fcontentful%2Fdeployed-dark.png&w=3840&q=75)
    

### [Content Link](#content-link)

Content Link is available on [Enterprise](/docs/plans/enterprise) and [Pro](/docs/plans/pro) plans

Content Link enables you to edit content on websites using headless CMSs by providing links on elements that match a content model in the CMS. This real-time content visualization allows collaborators to make changes without needing a developer's assistance.

You can enable Content Link on a preview deployment by selecting Edit Mode in the [Vercel Toolbar](/docs/vercel-toolbar) menu.

The corresponding model in the CMS determines an editable field. You can hover over an element to display a link in the top-right corner of the element and then select the link to open the related CMS field for editing.

You don't need any additional configuration or code changes on the page to use this feature.

To implement Content Link in your project, follow the steps in [Contentful's documentation](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/tools/vercel/content-source-maps-with-vercel/).

Last updated September 24, 2025

[Sitecore XM Cloud](https://www.sitecore.com/products/xm-cloud) is a CMS platform designed for both developers and marketers. It utilizes a headless architecture, which means content is managed independently from its presentation layer. This separation allows for content delivery across various channels and platforms.

This guide outlines the steps to integrate a headless JavaScript application on Vercel with Sitecore XM Cloud. In this guide, you will learn how to set up a new XM Cloud project in the XM Cloud Deploy app. Then, you will create a standalone Next.js JSS application that can connect to a new or an existing XM Cloud website. By the end, you'll understand how to create a new XM Cloud website and the steps necessary for connecting a Next.js application and deploying to Vercel.

The key parts you will learn from this guide are:

1.  Configuring the GraphQL endpoint for content retrieval from Sitecore XM Cloud
2.  Utilizing the Sitecore Next.js for JSS library for content integration
3.  Setting up environment variables in Vercel for Sitecore API key, GraphQL endpoint, and JSS app name

## [Creating a Next.js JSS application](#creating-a-next.js-jss-application)

To help get you started, we built a [template](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/sitecore-starter) using Sitecore JSS for Next.js with JSS SXA headless components. This template includes only the frontend Next.js application that connects to a new or existing hosted XM Cloud website. Note that it omits the Docker configuration for running XM Cloud locally. For details on local XM Cloud configuration, refer to Sitecore's [documentation](https://doc.sitecore.com/xmc/en/developers/xm-cloud/walkthrough--setting-up-your-full-stack-xm-cloud-local-development-environment.html).

Sitecore also offers a [JSS app initializer](https://doc.sitecore.com/xmc/en/developers/xm-cloud/the-jss-app-initializer.html) and templates for other popular JavaScript frameworks. You can also use the JSS application that's part of the XM Cloud starter foundation mentioned in the previous section.

You can either deploy the template above to Vercel with one-click, or use the steps below to clone it to your machine and deploy it locally.

1.  ### [Clone the repository](#clone-the-repository)
    
    You can clone the repo using the following command:
    
    terminal
    
    ```
    npx create-next-app --example cms-sitecore-xmcloud
    ```
    
2.  ### [Retrieve your API key, GraphQL endpoint, and JSS app name](#retrieve-your-api-key-graphql-endpoint-and-jss-app-name)
    
    Next, navigate to your newly created XM Cloud site under Sites and select Settings.
    
    ![](/vc-ap-vercel-docs/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F7nyt0uhk7sse4zvn.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs-assets%2Fstatic%2Fdocs%2Fintegrations%2Fsitecore%2Fsitecore-dashboard.png&w=3840&q=75)![](/vc-ap-vercel-docs/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F7nyt0uhk7sse4zvn.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs-assets%2Fstatic%2Fdocs%2Fintegrations%2Fsitecore%2Fsitecore-dashboard.png&w=3840&q=75)
    
    Under the Developer Settings tab select Generate API Key.
    
    ![](/vc-ap-vercel-docs/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F7nyt0uhk7sse4zvn.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs-assets%2Fstatic%2Fdocs%2Fintegrations%2Fsitecore%2Fdeveloper-settings.png&w=3840&q=75)![](/vc-ap-vercel-docs/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F7nyt0uhk7sse4zvn.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs-assets%2Fstatic%2Fdocs%2Fintegrations%2Fsitecore%2Fdeveloper-settings.png&w=3840&q=75)
    
    Save the `SITECORE_API_KEY`, `JSS_APP_NAME`, and `GRAPH_QL_ENDPOINT` values – you'll need it for the next step.
    
3.  ### [Configure your Next.js JSS application](#configure-your-next.js-jss-application)
    
    Next, add the `JSS_APP_NAME`, `GRAPH_QL_ENDPOINT` , `SITECORE_API_KEY`, and `SITECORE_API_HOST` values as environment variables for running locally. Create a new `.env.local` file in your application, copy the contents of `.env.example` and set the 4 environment variables.
    
    .env.local
    
    ```
    JSS_APP_NAME='your-jss-app-name'
    GRAPH_QL_ENDPOINT='your-graphql-endpoint'
    SITECORE_API_KEY='your-sitecore-api-key'
    SITECORE_API_HOST='host-from-endpoint'
    ```
    
4.  ### [Start your application](#start-your-application)
    
    You can now start your application with the following command:
    
    terminal
    
    ```
    npm install && npm run build && npm run dev
    ```
    

## [How it works](#how-it-works)

Sitecore XM Cloud offers a GraphQL endpoint for its sites, serving as the primary mechanism for both retrieving and updating content. The Sitecore JSS library for Next.js provides the necessary components and tools for rendering and editing Sitecore data.

Through this integration, content editors can log into XM Cloud to not only modify content but also adjust the composition of pages.

The frontend application hosted on Vercel establishes a connection to Sitecore XM Cloud using the `GRAPH_QL_ENDPOINT` to determine the data source and the `SITECORE_API_KEY` to ensure secure access to the content.

With these components in place, developers can seamlessly integrate content from Sitecore XM Cloud into a Next.js application on Vercel.

Vercel Deployment Protection is enabled for new projects by [default](/changelog/deployment-protection-is-now-enabled-by-default-for-new-projects) which limits access to preview and production URLs. This may impact Sitecore Experience Editor and Pages functionality. Refer to Deployment Protection [documentation](/docs/security/deployment-protection) and Sitecore XM Cloud [documentation](https://doc.sitecore.com/xmc/en/developers/xm-cloud/use-vercel-s-deployment-protection-feature-with-jss-apps.html) for more details and integration steps.

## [Deploying to Vercel](#deploying-to-vercel)

1.  ### [Push to Git](#push-to-git)
    
    Ensure your integrated application code is pushed to your git repository.
    
    terminal
    
    ```
    git init
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    git remote add origin [repository url]
    git push -u origin main
    ```
    
2.  ### [Import to Vercel](#import-to-vercel)
    
    Log in to your Vercel account (or create one) and import your project into Vercel using the [import flow](https://vercel.com/new).
    
    ![](/vc-ap-vercel-docs/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F7nyt0uhk7sse4zvn.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs-assets%2Fstatic%2Fdocs%2Fintegrations%2Fsitecore%2Fimport-vercel-light.png&w=3840&q=75)![](/vc-ap-vercel-docs/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F7nyt0uhk7sse4zvn.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs-assets%2Fstatic%2Fdocs%2Fintegrations%2Fsitecore%2Fimport-vercel-dark.png&w=3840&q=75)
    
3.  ### [Configure environment variables](#configure-environment-variables)
    
    Add the `FETCH_WITH`, `JSS_APP_NAME`, `GRAPH_QL_ENDPOINT` , `SITECORE_API_KEY`, and `SITECORE_API_HOST` environment variables to the Environment Variables section.
    
    .env.local
    
    ```
    JSS_APP_NAME='your-jss-app-name'
    GRAPH_QL_ENDPOINT='your-graphql-endpoint'
    SITECORE_API_KEY='your-sitecore-api-key'
    SITECORE_API_HOST='host-from-endpoint'
    FETCH_WITH='GraphQL'
    ```
    
    Select "Deploy" and your application will be live on Vercel!
    
    ![](/vc-ap-vercel-docs/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F7nyt0uhk7sse4zvn.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs-assets%2Fstatic%2Fdocs%2Fintegrations%2Fsitecore%2Fsuccess-vercel-light.png&w=3840&q=75)![](/vc-ap-vercel-docs/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F7nyt0uhk7sse4zvn.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs-assets%2Fstatic%2Fdocs%2Fintegrations%2Fsitecore%2Fsuccess-vercel-dark.png&w=3840&q=75)

# Integrate with Vercel

Copy page

Ask AI about this page

Last updated September 30, 2025

This guide walks you through the process of creating and managing integrations on Vercel, helping you to extend the capabilities of your Vercel projects by connecting with third-party services.

## [Understanding native integrations](#understanding-native-integrations)

Given the strong connection and flexibility of [native integrations](/docs/integrations#native-integrations) with Vercel, understanding the fundamentals of how they interact with Vercel's platform will facilitate the creation and optimization of native integrations for integration providers.

Review [Native Integration Concepts](/docs/integrations/create-integration/native-integration) and [Native Integration Flows](/docs/integrations/create-integration/marketplace-flows) to learn more.

## [Creating an integration](#creating-an-integration)

Integrations can be created by filling out the Create Integration form. To access the form:

1.  From your Vercel [dashboard](/dashboard), select your account/team from the [scope selector](/docs/dashboard-features#scope-selector)
2.  Select the Integrations tab to see the Integrations overview
3.  Then, select the [Integrations Console](/dashboard/integrations/console) button and then select Create
4.  Fill out all the entries in the [Create integration form](#create-integration-form-details) as necessary
5.  At the end of the form, depending on the type of integration you are creating, you must accept the terms provided by Vercel so that your integration can be published
6.  If you are creating a native integration, continue to the [Native integration product creation](#native-integration-product-creation) process.

### [Native integration product creation](#native-integration-product-creation)

In order to create native integrations, please share your `team_id` and Integration's [URL Slug](/docs/integrations/create-integration/submit-integration#url-slug) with Vercel in your shared Slack channel (`#shared-mycompanyname`). You can sign up to be a native integration provider [here](/marketplace-providers).

You can create your product(s) using the [Create product form](#create-product-form-details) after you have submitted the integration form. Review the [storage product creation flow](/docs/integrations/create-integration/marketplace-flows#create-a-storage-product-flow) to understand the sequence your integration server needs to handle when a Vercel user installs your product.

## [After integration creation](#after-integration-creation)

### [Native integrations](#native-integrations)

To create a product for your [native integration](/docs/integrations#native-integrations), follow the steps in [Create a product for a native integration](/docs/integrations/marketplace-product).

### [Connectable account integrations](#connectable-account-integrations)

Once you have created your [connectable account integration](/docs/integrations#connectable-accounts), it will be assigned the [Community badge](/docs/integrations/create-integration#community-badge) and be available for external users to download. You can share it with users either through your site or through the Vercel [deploy button](/docs/deploy-button/integrations).

If you are interested in having your integration listed on the public [Integrations](/integrations) page:

*   The integration must have at least 500 active installations (500 accounts that have the integration installed).
*   The integration follows our [review guidelines](/docs/integrations/create-integration/approval-checklist).
*   Once you've reached this minimum install requirement, please email [integrations@vercel.com](mailto:integrations@vercel.com) with your request to be reviewed for listing.

### [View created integration](#view-created-integration)

You can view all integrations that you have created on the [Integrations Console](/dashboard/integrations/console).

To preview an integration's live URL, click View Integration. This URL can be shared for installation based on the integration's visibility settings.

The live URL has the following format:

example-url

```
https://vercel.com/integrations/<slug>
```

Where, `<slug>` is the name you specified in the URL Slug field during the integration creation process.

### [View logs](#view-logs)

To help troubleshoot errors with your integration, select the View Logs button on the Edit Integration page. You will see a list of all requests made to this integration with the most recent at the top. You can use filters on the left column such as selecting only requests with the `error` level. When you select a row, you can view the detailed information for that request in the right column.

### [Community badge](#community-badge)

In the [Integrations Console](/dashboard/integrations/console), a Community badge will appear under your new integration's title once you have submitted the integration. While integrations with a Community badge do not appear in the [marketplace](https://vercel.com/integrations), they are available to be installed through your site or through the Vercel [deploy button](/docs/deploy-button/integrations)

Community integrations are developed by third parties and are supported solely by the developers. Before installing, review the developer's Privacy Policy and End User License Agreement on the integration page.

## [Installation flow](#installation-flow)

The installation of the integration is a critical component of the developer experience that must cater to all types of developers. While deciding the installation flow you should consider the following:

*   New user flow: Developers should be able to create an account on your service while installing the integration
*   Existing user flow: With existing accounts, developers should sign in as they install the integration. Also, make sure the forgotten password flow doesn't break the installation flow
*   Strong defaults: The installation flow should have minimal steps and have set defaults whenever possible
*   Advanced settings: Provide developers with the ability to override or expand settings when installing the integration

For the installation flow, you should consider adding the following specs:

| Spec Name | Required | Spec Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Documentation | Yes | Explain the integration and how to use it. Also explain the defaults and how to override them. |
| Deploy Button | No | Create a [Deploy Button](/docs/deploy-button) for projects based on a Git repository. |

## [Integration support](#integration-support)

As an integration creator, you are solely responsible for the support of your integration developed and listed on Vercel. When providing user support, your response times and the scope of support must be the same or exceed the level of [Vercel's support](/legal/support-terms). For more information, refer to the [Vercel Integrations Marketplace Agreement](/legal/integrations-marketplace-agreement).

When submitting an integration, you'll enter a [support email](/docs/integrations/create-integration/submit-integration#email), which will be listed publicly. It's through this email that integration users will be able to reach out to you.

# Integration Approval Checklist

Copy page

Ask AI about this page

Last updated March 10, 2025

Use this checklist to ensure all necessary steps have been taken for a great integration experience to get listed on the [Integration Marketplace](/integrations). Make sure you read the [after integration creation guide](/docs/integrations/create-integration#after-integration-creation) before you start.

## [Marketplace listing](#marketplace-listing)

Navigate to `/integrations/:slug` to view the listing for the integration.

*   Is the [logo](/docs/integrations/create-integration/submit-integration#logo) properly centered and cropped? Does it look good in both light and dark mode?
    

*   Is the first image high-quality and suitable to be used in a [Open Graph (OG)](/docs/og-image-generation) image (that gets automatically generated)?
    
*   Check to see if any of the images are blurry or show info they shouldn't. Do they all look professional / well polished?
    

Examples:

*   [
    
    MongoDB Atlas
    
    ](https://vercel.com/integrations/mongodbatlas)
*   [
    
    Sanity
    
    ](https://vercel.com/integrations/sanity)

## [Overview and instructions](#overview-and-instructions)

*   Does the description section use markdown where appropriate. For example, `[link](#)`
    
*   If there is an Instructions section, is it additional and helpful information? Avoid a step-by-step guide on how to install it.
    
*   Do the instructions clearly mention all [environment variables](/docs/integrations/create-integration/submit-integration#additional-information) that get set and ideally, what they are used for? Use the [comment property](/docs/rest-api/endpoints#projects/create-one-or-more-environment-variables/body-parameters) when creating environment variables.
    
*   Does additional documentation exist? If so, is the documentation URL set?
    

## [Installation flow](#installation-flow)

From clicking the install button, a wizard should pop up, guiding you through the setup process.

*   Does the UI offer to select and map Vercel projects with the third-party? Important: Note that the project selection before the popup exists for security reasons. It does not imply the projects on which the user wants to install the integration.
    
*   Does the UI intelligently pre-select the first Vercel project to streamline the installation process and minimize user interaction?
    
*   If a user limits the scope to a single project within Vercel, does the popup obey this / make sense? Is the project selection disabled?
    
*   Are long project names on the project selection handled correctly without breaking the UI?
    
*   Does the UI come with sensible defaults during installation?
    
*   Are advanced settings hidden behind a toggle? For example, for a database integration selecting the region, RAM & CPU should be preselected and hidden so the UI is not bloated by many settings
    
*   Does the UI use pagination when listing all available projects? Users may have more than the pagination limit of the projects API.
    
*   Is it impossible for users to exit the installation flow? Links such as the logo or footer should always open in a new tab to prevent users from navigating away from the redirect URL during installation.
    
*   Does the authentication flow, such as sign-up, login, or forgotten password, work without interrupting the installation process? Can the user complete the installation successfully?
    

### [Deploy button flow](#deploy-button-flow)

Using [Deploy Buttons](/docs/deploy-button) allows users to install an integration together with an example repository on GitHub.

*   Does the integration crash if it's already present on the [selected scope](/docs/integrations/create-integration/submit-integration#deploy-button-installation-flow)? The integration shouldn't treat the passed `configurationId` as a new installation since it was previously installed.
    

## [Integration is installed successfully](#integration-is-installed-successfully)

After we have installed an integration (through the Marketplace), you should be presented with the details of your installation.

*   Is there a Configuration URL for the integration? Users should be able to modify linked projects by selecting projects in a similar way as during installation.
    
*   Are the environment variables set correctly with the right target?

Last updated July 18, 2025

With deployment integration actions, integration providers can enable [integration resource](/docs/integrations/create-integration/native-integration#resources) tasks to be performed such as branching a database, setting environment variables, and running readiness checks. It then allows integration users to configure and trigger these actions automatically during a deployment.

For example, you can use deployment integration actions with the checks API to [create integrations](/docs/checks#build-your-checks-integration) that provide testing functionality to deployments.

## [How deployment actions work](#how-deployment-actions-work)

1.  Action declaration:
    
    *   An integration [product](/docs/integrations/create-integration/native-integration#resources) declares deployment actions with an ID, name, and metadata.
    *   Actions can specify configuration options that integration users can modify.
    *   Actions can include suggestions for default actions to run such as "this action should be run on previews".
2.  Project configuration:
    
    *   When a resource is connected to a project, integration users select which actions should be triggered during deployments.
    *   Integration users are also presented with suggestions on what actions to run if these were configured in the action declaration.
3.  Deployment execution:
    
    *   When a deployment is created, the configured actions are registered on the deployment.
    *   The registered actions trigger the `deployment.integration.action.start` webhook.
    *   If a deployment is canceled, the `deployment.integration.action.cancel` webhook is triggered.
4.  Resource-side processing:
    
    *   The integration provider processes the webhook, executing the necessary resource-side actions such as creating a database branch.
    *   During the processing of these actions, the build is blocked and the deployment set in a provisioning state.
    *   Once complete, the integration provider updates the action status.
5.  Deployment unblock:
    
    *   Vercel validates the completed action, updates environment variables, and unblocks the deployment.

## [Creating deployment actions](#creating-deployment-actions)

As an integration provider, to allow your integration users to add deployment actions to an installed native integration, follow these steps:

1.  ### [Declare deployment actions](#declare-deployment-actions)
    
    Declare the deployment actions for your native integration product.
    
    1.  Open the Integration Console.
    2.  Select your Marketplace integration and click Manage.
    3.  Edit an existing product or create a new one.
    4.  Go to Deployment Actions in the left-side menu.
    5.  Create an action by assigning it a slug and a name.
    
    Next, handle webhook events and perform API actions in your [integration server](/docs/integrations/marketplace-product#deploy-the-integration-server). Review the [example marketplace integration server](https://github.com/vercel/example-marketplace-integration) code repository.
    
2.  ### [Handle the deployment start](#handle-the-deployment-start)
    
    Handle the `deployment.integration.action.start` webhook. This webhook triggers when a deployment starts an action.
    
    This is a webhook payload example:
    
    ```
    {
      "installationId": "icfg_1234567",
      "action": "branch",
      "resourceId": "abc-def-1334",
      "deployment": { "id": "dpl_568301234" }
    }
    ```
    
    This payload provides IDs for the installation, action, resource, and deployment.
    
3.  ### [Use the Get Deployment API](#use-the-get-deployment-api)
    
    You can retrieve additional deployment details using the [Get a deployment by ID or URL](https://vercel.com/docs/rest-api/endpoints#tag/deployments/get-a-deployment-by-id-or-url) endpoint:
    
    ```
    curl https://api.vercel.com/v13/deployments/dpl_568301234 \
      -H "Authorization: {access_token}"
    ```
    
    You can create your `access_token` from [Vercel's account settings](/docs/rest-api#creating-an-access-token).
    
    Review the [full code](https://github.com/vercel/example-marketplace-integration/blob/6d2372b8afdab36a0c7f42e1c5a4f0deb2c496c1/app/dashboard/webhook-events/actions.tsx) for handling the deployment start in the example marketplace integration server.
    
4.  ### [Complete a deployment action](#complete-a-deployment-action)
    
    Once an action is processed, update its status using the [Update Deployment Integration Action](/docs/rest-api/reference/endpoints/deployments/update-deployment-integration-action) REST API endpoint.
    
    Example request to this endpoint:
    
    ```
    PATCH https://api.vercel.com/v1/deployments/{deploymentId}/integrations/{installationId}/resources/{resourceId}/actions/{action}
    ```
    
    Example request body to send that includes the resulting updated resource secrets:
    
    ```
    {
      "status": "succeeded",
      "outcomes": [
        {
          "kind": "resource-secrets",
          "secrets": [{ "name": "TOP_SECRET", "value": "****" }]
        }
      ]
    }
    ```
    
5.  ### [Handle deployment cancellation](#handle-deployment-cancellation)
    
    When a deployment is canceled, the `deployment.integration.action.cancel` webhook is triggered. You should handle this action to clean up any partially completed actions.
    
    Use the `deployment.integration.action.cleanup` webhook to clean up any persistent state linked to the deployment. It's triggered when a deployment is removed from the system.

# Native Integration Flows

Copy page

Ask AI about this page

Last updated September 30, 2025

As a Vercel integration provider, when you [create a native product integration](/docs/integrations/marketplace-product), you need to set up the [integration server](https://github.com/vercel/example-marketplace-integration) and use the [Vercel marketplace Rest API](/docs/integrations/marketplace-api) to manage the interaction between the integration user and your product.

The following diagrams help you understand how information flows in both directions between the integration user, Vercel and your native integration product for each key interaction between the integration user and the Vercel dashboard.

## [Create a storage product flow](#create-a-storage-product-flow)

When a Vercel user, who wants to install a provider native integration, selects the Storage tab of the Vercel dashboard, followed by Create Database, they are taken through the following steps to provide the key information required for the provider to be able to create a product for this user.

After reviewing the flow diagram below, explore the sequence for each step:

*   [Select storage product](#select-storage-product)
*   [Select billing plan](#select-billing-plan)
*   [Submit store creation](#submit-store-creation)

Loading..

Understanding the details of each step will help you set up the installation section of the [integration server](https://github.com/vercel/example-marketplace-integration).

### [Select storage product](#select-storage-product)

When the integration user selects a storage provider product, an account is created for this user on the provider's side if the account does not exist. If that's the case, the user is presented with the Accept Terms modal.

Loading..

### [Select billing plan](#select-billing-plan)

Using the installation id for this product and integration user, the Vercel dashboard presents available billing plans for the product. The integration user then selects a plan from the list which is updated on every user input change.

Loading..

### [Submit store creation](#submit-store-creation)

After confirming the plan selection, the integration user is presented with information fields that the integration provider specified in the [metadata schema](/docs/integrations/marketplace-product#metadata-schema) section of the integration settings. The user updates these fields and submits the form to initiate the creation of the store for this user on the provider platform.

Loading..

## [Connections between Vercel and the provider](#connections-between-vercel-and-the-provider)

### [Open in Provider button flow](#open-in-provider-button-flow)

When an integration user selects the Manage button for a product integration from the Vercel dashboard's Integrations tab, they are taken to the installation settings page for that integration. When they select the Open in \[provider\] button, they are taken to the provider's dashboard page in a new window. The diagram below describes the flow of information for authentication and information exchange when this happens.

Loading..

### [Provider to Vercel data sync flow](#provider-to-vercel-data-sync-flow)

This flow happens when a provider edits information about a resource in the provider's system.

Loading..

### [Vercel to Provider data sync flow](#vercel-to-provider-data-sync-flow)

This flow happens when a user who has installed the product integration edits information about it on the Vercel dashboard.

Loading..

### [Rotate credentials in provider flow](#rotate-credentials-in-provider-flow)

This flow happens when a provider rotates the credentials of a resource in the provider system.

Loading..

Vercel will update the environment variables of projects connected to the resource but will not automatically redeploy the projects. The user must redeploy them manually.

## [Flows for the Experimentation category](#flows-for-the-experimentation-category)

### [Experimentation flow](#experimentation-flow)

This flow applies to the products in the Experimentation category, enabling providers to display [feature flags](/docs/feature-flags) in the Vercel dashboard.

Loading..

### [Experimentation Edge Config Syncing](#experimentation-edge-config-syncing)

This flow applies to integration products in the Experimentation category. It enables providers to push the necessary configuration data for resolving flags and experiments into an [Edge Config](/docs/edge-config) on the team's account, ensuring near-instant resolution.

Loading..

Edge Config Syncing is an optional feature that providers can enable for their integration. Users can opt in by enabling it for their installation in the Vercel Dashboard.

Users can enable this setting either during the integration's installation or later through the installation's settings page. Providers must handle this setting in their [Provision Resource](/docs/integrations/marketplace-api#provision-resource) and [Update Resource](/docs/integrations/create-integration/marketplace-api#update-resource) endpoints.

The presence of `protocolSettings.experimentation.edgeConfigId` in the payload indicates that the user has enabled the setting and expects their Edge Config to be used.

Afterward, providers can use the [Edge Config Syncing](/docs/integrations/create-integration/marketplace-api#push-data-into-a-user-provided-edge-config) endpoint to push their data into the user's Edge Config.

Once the data is available, users can connect the resource to a Vercel project. Doing so will add an `EXPERIMENTATION_CONFIG` environment variable containing the Edge Config connection string along with the provider's secrets.

Users can then use the appropriate [adapter provided by the Flags SDK](https://flags-sdk.dev/providers), which will utilize the Edge Config.

## [Resources with Claim Deployments](#resources-with-claim-deployments)

When a Vercel user claims deployment ownership with the [Claim Deployments feature](/docs/deployments/claim-deployments), storage integration resources associated with the project can also be transferred. To facilitate this transfer for your storage integration, use the following flows.

### [Provision flow](#provision-flow)

This flow describes how a claims generator (e.g. AI agent) provisions a provider resource and connects it to a Vercel project. Before the flow begins, the claims generator must have installed the provider's integration. The flow results in the claims generator's Vercel team having a provider resource installed and connected to a project under that team.

Loading..

### [Transfer request creation flow](#transfer-request-creation-flow)

This flow describes how a claims generator initiates a request to transfer provider resources, with Vercel as an intermediary. The flow results in the claims generator obtaining a claim code from Vercel and the provider issuing a provider claim ID for the pending resource transfer.

Loading..

Example for `CreateResourceTransfer` request:

terminal

```
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.vercel.com/projects/<project_id>/transfer-request\?teamId\=<team_id> \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{}'
```

`CreateResourceTransfer` response with a claim ID:

terminal

```
{ "code": "c7a9f0b4-4d4a-45bf-b550-2bfa34de1c0d" }
```

### [Transfer request accept flow](#transfer-request-accept-flow)

This flow describes how a Vercel user accepts a resource transfer request when they visit a Vercel URL sent by the claims generator. The URL includes a unique claim code that initiates the transfer to a target team the user own. Vercel and the provider verify and execute the transfer, resulting in the ownership of the project and associated resources being transferred to the user.

# Create a Native Integration

Copy page

Ask AI about this page

Last updated October 4, 2025

With a product, you allow a Vercel customer who has installed your integration to use specific features of your integration without having them leave the Vercel dashboard and create a separate account on your platform. You can create multiple products for each integration and each integration connects to Vercel through specific categories.

## [Requirements](#requirements)

To create and list your products as a Vercel provider, you need to:

*   Use a Vercel Team on a [Pro plan](/docs/plans/pro-plan).
*   Provide a Base URL in the product specification for a native integration server that you will create based on:
    *   The [sample integration server repository](https://github.com/vercel/example-marketplace-integration).
    *   The [native integrations API endpoints](/docs/integrations/marketplace-api).
*   Be an approved provider so that your product is available in the Vercel Marketplace. To do so, [submit your application](https://vercel.com/marketplace-providers#become-a-provider) to the Vercel Marketplace program.

## [Create your product](#create-your-product)

In this tutorial, you create a storage product for your native integration through the following steps:

1.  ### [Set up the integration](#set-up-the-integration)
    
    Before you can create a product, you must have an existing integration. [Create a new Native Integration](/docs/integrations/create-integration) or use your existing one.
    
2.  ### [Deploy the integration server](#deploy-the-integration-server)
    
    In order to deploy the integration server, you should update your integration configuration to set the base URL to the integration server URL:
    
    1.  Select the team you would like to use from the scope selector.
    2.  From your dashboard, select the Integrations tab and then select the Integrations Console button.
    3.  Select the integration you would like to use for the product.
    4.  Find the base URL field in the Product section and set it to the integration server URL.
    5.  Select Update.
    
    You can use this [example Next.js application](https://github.com/vercel/example-marketplace-integration) as a guide to create your integration server
    
3.  ### [Add a new product](#add-a-new-product)
    
    1.  Select the integration you would like to use for the product from the Integrations Console
    2.  Select Create Product from the Products card of the Product section
4.  ### [Complete the fields and save](#complete-the-fields-and-save)
    
    You should now see the Create Product form. Fill in the following fields:
    
    1.  Complete the Name, URL Slug, Visibility and Short Description fields
    2.  Optionally update the following in the [Metadata Schema](#metadata-schema) field:
    
    *   Edit the `properties` of the JSON schema to match the options that you are making available through the integration server.
    *   Edit and check that the attributes of each property such as `type` matches your requirements.
    *   Include the billing plan options that Vercel will send to your integration server when requesting the list of billing plans.
    *   Use the Preview Form section to check your JSON schema as you update it.
    
    Review the data collection process shown in the [submit store creation flow](/docs/integrations/create-integration/marketplace-flows#submit-store-creation) to understand the impact of the metadata schema.
    
    1.  Select Apply Changes
5.  ### [Update your integration server](#update-your-integration-server)
    
    Add or update the [Billing](/docs/integrations/marketplace-api#billing) endpoints in your integration server so that the appropriate plans are pulled from your backend when Vercel calls these endpoints. Review the [marketplace integration example](https://github.com/vercel/example-marketplace-integration/blob/main/app/v1/products/%5BproductId%5D/plans/route.ts) for a sample billing plan route.
    
    Your integration server needs to handle the [billing plan selection flow](/docs/integrations/create-integration/marketplace-flows#select-billing-plan) and [resource provisioning flow](/docs/integrations/create-integration/marketplace-flows#submit-store-creation).
    
6.  ### [Publish your product](#publish-your-product)
    
    To publish your product, you'll need to request for the new product to be approved:
    
    1.  Check that your product integration follows our [review guidelines](/docs/integrations/create-integration/approval-checklist)
    2.  Email [integrations@vercel.com](mailto:integrations@vercel.com) with your request to be reviewed for listing
    
    Once approved, Vercel customers can now add your product with the integration and select a billing plan.
    

## [Reference](#reference)

### [Metadata schema](#metadata-schema)

When you first create your product, you will see a [JSON schema](https://json-schema.org/) in the Metadata Schema field of the product configuration options. You will edit this schema to match the options you want to make available in the Vercel integration dashboard to the customer who installs this product integration.

When the customer installs your product, Vercel collects data from this customer and sends it to your integration server based on the Metadata schema you provided in the product configuration. The schema includes properties specific to Vercel that allow the Vercel dashboard to understand how to render the user interface to collect this data from the customer.

As an example, use the following configuration to only show the name of the product:

```
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {},
  "additionalProperties": false,
  "required": []
}
```

See the endpoints for [Provision](/docs/integrations/marketplace-api#provision-resource) or [Update](/docs/integrations/marketplace-api#update-resource) Resource for specific examples.

| Property `ui:control` | Property `type` | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `input` | `number` | Number input |
| `input` | `string` | Text input |
| `toggle` | `boolean` | Toggle input |
| `slider` | `array` | Slider input. The `items` property of your array must have a type of number |
| `select` | `string` | Dropdown input |
| `multi-select` | `array` | Dropdown with multi-select input. The items property of your array must have a type of string |
| `vercel-region` | `string` | Vercel Region dropdown input. You can restrict the list of available regions by settings the acceptable regions in the enum property |
| `multi-vercel-region` | `array` | Vercel Region dropdown with multi-select input. You can restrict the list of available regions by settings the acceptable regions in the enum property of your items. Your items property must have type of string |
| `domain` | `string` | Domain name input |
| `git-namespace` | `string` | Git namespace selector |

This table shows the possible keys for the `properties` object that each represent a type of `ui:control` that is a form element to be used on the Vercel dashboard for this property.

See the [full JSON schema](https://vercel.com/api/v1/integrations/marketplace/metadata-schema) for the Metadata Schema. You can add it to your code editor for autocomplete and validation.

You can add it to your editor configuration as follows:

```
{
  "$schema": "https://vercel.com/api/v1/integrations/marketplace/metadata-schema"
}

# Native integration concepts

Copy page

Ask AI about this page

Last updated September 30, 2025

Native integrations allow a two-way connection between Vercel and third-party providers. This enables providers to embed their services into the Vercel ecosystem so that Vercel customers can subscribe to third-party products directly through the Vercel dashboard, providing several key benefits to the integration user:

*   They do not need to create an account on your site.
*   They can choose suitable billing plans for each product through the Vercel dashboard.
*   Billing is managed through their Vercel account.

This document outlines core concepts, structure, and best practices for creating robust, scalable integrations that align with Vercel's ecosystem and user expectations.

## [Team installations](#team-installations)

Team installations are the foundation of native integrations, providing a secure and organized way to connect user teams with specific integrations. You can then enable centralized management and access control to integration resources through the Vercel dashboard.

| Concept | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| Team installation | The primary connection between a user's team and a specific integration. |
| [`installationId`](/docs/integrations/marketplace-api#installations) | The main partition key connecting the user's team to the integration. |

### [Limits](#limits)

Understanding the limits of team installation instances for all types of integrations can help you design a better integration architecture.

| Metric | Limit |
| --- | --- |
| [Native integration](/docs/integrations#native-integrations) installation | A maximum of one installation instance of a specific provider's native integration per team. |
| [Connectable account integration](/docs/integrations/create-integration#connectable-account-integrations) installation | A maximum of one installation instance of a specific provider's connectable account integration per team. |

## [Products](#products)

Products represent the offerings available within an integration, allowing integration users to select and customize an asset such as "ACME Redis Database" or a service such as "ACME 24/7 support" that they would like to use and subscribe to. They provide a structured way to package and present integration capabilities to users.

| Concept | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| Product | An offering that integration users can add to their native integration installation. A provider can offer multiple products through one integration. |
| [Billing plan](#billing-and-usage) | Each product has an associated pricing structure that the provider specifies when creating products. |

## [Resources](#resources)

Resources are the actual instances of products that integration users provision and utilize. They provide the flexibility and granularity needed for users to tailor the integration to their specific needs and project structures.

| Concept | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| Resource | A specific instance of a product provisioned in an installation. |
| Provisioning | Explicit creation and removal (de-provisioning) of resources by users. |
| Keysets | Independent sets of secrets for each resource. |
| Project connection | Ability to link resources to Vercel projects independently. |

### [Resource usage patterns](#resource-usage-patterns)

Integration users can add and manage resources in various ways. For example:

*   Single resource: Using one resource such as one database for all projects.
*   Per-project resources: Dedicating separate resources for each project.
*   Environment-specific resources: Using separate resources for different environments (development, preview, production) within a project.

## [Relationships](#relationships)

The diagram below illustrates the relationships between team installations, products, and resources:

Loading..

*   One installation can host multiple products and resources.
*   One product can have multiple resource instances.
*   Resources can be connected to multiple projects independently.

## [Billing and usage](#billing-and-usage)

Billing and usage tracking are crucial aspects of native integrations that are designed to help you create a system of transparent billing based on resource utilization. It enables flexible pricing models and provides users with clear insights into their integration costs.

| Concept | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| Resource-level billing | Billing and usage can be tracked separately for each resource. |
| [Installation-level billing](/docs/integrations/create-integration/submit-integration#installation-level-billing-plans) | Billing and usage for all resources can also be combined under one installation. |
| Billing plan and payment | A plan can be of type prepaid or subscription. You ensure that the correct plans are pulled from your backend with your [integration server](/docs/integrations/marketplace-product#update-your-integration-server) before you submit a product for review. |

We recommend you implement resource-level billing, which is the default, to provide users with detailed cost breakdowns and enable more flexible pricing strategies.

## [More resources](#more-resources)

To successfully implement your native integration, you'll need to handle several key flows:

*   [Storage product creation flow](/docs/integrations/create-integration/marketplace-flows#create-a-storage-product-flow)
*   [Data synchronization flows between Vercel and the provider](/docs/integrations/create-integration/marketplace-flows#connections-between-vercel-and-the-provider)
*   [Provider dashboard access](/docs/integrations/create-integration/marketplace-flows#open-in-provider-button-flow)
*   [Credential management](/docs/integrations/create-integration/marketplace-flows#rotate-credentials-in-provider-flow)

See the [Webhooks](/docs/webhooks) documentation to learn more.

## [Configuration URL](#configuration-url)

*   Required: No

To allow the developer to configure an installed integration, you can specify a Configuration URL. This URL is used for the Configure button on each configuration page. Selecting this button will redirect the developer to your specified URL with a `configurationId` query parameter. See [Interacting with Configurations](/docs/rest-api/vercel-api-integrations#interacting-with-configurations) to learn more.

If you leave the Configuration URL field empty, the Configure button will default to a Website button that links to the website URL you specified on integration settings.

## [Marketplace Integration Settings](#marketplace-integration-settings)

## [Base URL](#base-url)

*   Required: If it's a product

The URL that points to the provider's integration server that implements the [Marketplace Provider API](/docs/integrations/marketplace-api). To interact with the provider's application, Vercel makes a request to the base URL appended with the path for the specific endpoint.

For example, if the base url is `https://foo.bar.com/vercel-integration-server`, Vercel makes a `POST` request to something like `https://foo.bar.com/vercel-integration-server/v1/installations`.

## [Redirect Login URL](#redirect-login-url)

*   Required: If it's a product

The URL where Vercel redirect users of the integration in the following situations:

*   They open the link to the integration provider's dashboard from the Vercel dashboard as explained in the [Open in Provider button flow](/docs/integrations/create-integration/marketplace-flows#open-in-provider-button-flow)
*   They open a specific resource on the Vercel dashboard

This allows providers to automatically log users into their dashboard without asking them to log in.

## [Installation-level Billing Plans](#installation-level-billing-plans)

*   Required: No (It's a toggle which is disabled by default)
*   Applies to a installation

When enabled, it allows the integration user to select a billing plan for their installation. The default installation-level billing plan is chosen by the partner. When disabled, the installation does not have a configurable billing plan.

### [Usage](#usage)

If the billing for your integration happens at the team, organization or account level, enable this toggle to allow Vercel to fetch the installation-level billing plans. When the user selects an installation-level billing plan, you can then upgrade the plan for this team, account or organization when you provision the product.

The user can update this installation-level plan at any time from the installation detail page of the Vercel dashboard.

## [Terms of Service](#terms-of-service)

## [Integrations Agreement](#integrations-agreement)

*   Required:
    *   Yes: If it's a connectable account integration or this is the first time you are creating a native integration
    *   No: If you are adding a product to the integration. A different agreement may be needed for the first added product

You must agree to the Vercel terms before your integration can be published. The terms may differ depending the type of integration, [connectable account](/docs/integrations/create-integration#connectable-account-integrations) or [native](/docs/integrations#native-integrations).

### [Marketplace installation flow](#marketplace-installation-flow)

Usage Scenario: For installations initiated from the [Vercel Marketplace](/integrations).

You can include secrets in the following way:

```
import { createClient } from 'acme-sdk';
 
const client = createClient('https://your-project.acme.com', '{{YOUR_SECRET}}');
```

When integration users view your snippet in the Vercel dashboard, `{{YOUR_SECRET}}` is replaced with a `*` accompanied by a Show Secrets button. The secret value is revealed when they click the button.

If you're using TypeScript or JavaScript snippets, you can use `{{process.env.YOUR_SECRET}}`. In this case, the snippet view in the Vercel dashboard shows `process.env.YOUR_SECRET` instead of a `*` accompanied by the Show Secrets button.

### [Edge Config Support](#edge-config-support)

When enabled, integration users can choose an [Edge Config](/docs/edge-config) to access experimentation feature flag data.

### [Log Drain Settings](#log-drain-settings)

When enabled, the integration user can configure a Log Drain for the Native integration. Once the `Delivery Format` is chosen, the integration user can define the Log Drain `Endpoint` and `Headers`, which can be replaced with the environment variables defined by the integration.

# Upgrade an Integration

Copy page

Ask AI about this page

Last updated September 24, 2025

You should upgrade your integration if you are using any of the following scenarios.

## [Upgrading your Integration](#upgrading-your-integration)

If your Integration is using outdated features on the Vercel Platform, [follow these guidelines](/docs/integrations/create-integration/upgrade-integration#upgrading-your-integration) to upgrade your Integration and use the latest features.

Once ready, make sure to [submit your Integration](/docs/integrations/create-integration/submit-integration) for review after you upgraded it.

## [Use generic Webhooks](#use-generic-webhooks)

You can now specify a generic Webhook URL in your Integration settings. Use generic Webhooks instead of Webhooks APIs and Delete Hooks.

The Vercel REST API to list, create, and delete Webhooks [has been removed](https://vercel.com/changelog/sunsetting-ui-hooks-and-legacy-webhooks). There's also no support for Delete Hooks which are notified on Integration Configuration removal. If you have been using either or both features, you need to update your Integration.

Show More

## [Use External Flow](#use-external-flow)

If your Integration is using the OAuth2 installation flow, you should use the [External installation flow](/docs/integrations/create-integration/submit-integration#external-installation-flow) instead. By using the External flow, users will be able to choose which Vercel scope (Personal Account or Team) to install your Integration to.

Show More

## [Use your own UI](#use-your-own-ui)

UI Hooks is a deprecated feature that allowed you to create custom configuration UI for your Integration inside the Vercel dashboard. If your Integration is using UI Hooks, you should build your own UI instead.

Show More

## [Legacy Integrations](#legacy-integrations)

Integration that use UI Hooks are now [fully deprecated](https://vercel.com/changelog/sunsetting-ui-hooks-and-legacy-webhooks). Users are not able to install them anymore.

If you are using a Legacy Integrations, it's recommended finding an updated Integration on the [Integrations Marketplace](https://vercel.com/integrations). If adequate replacement is not available, contact the integration developer for more information.

## [`currentProjectId` in Deploy Button](#currentprojectid-in-deploy-button)

If your Integration is not using `currentProjectId` to determine the target project for the Deploy Button flow, please use it. [Here’s the documentation](/docs/deploy-button).

## [Single installation per scope](#single-installation-per-scope)

If your Integration assumes that it can be installed multiple times in a Vercel scope (Hobby team or team), read the following so that it can support single installation per scope for each flow:

[BigCommerce](https://www.bigcommerce.com/) is an ecommerce platform for building and managing online storefronts. This guide explains how to deploy a highly performant, headless storefront using Next.js on Vercel.

## [Overview](#overview)

This guide uses [Catalyst](/templates/next.js/catalyst-by-bigcommerce) by BigCommerce to connect your BigCommerce store to a Vercel deployment. Catalyst was developed by BigCommerce in collaboration with Vercel.

You can use this guide as a reference for creating a custom headless BigCommerce storefront, even if you're not using Catalyst by BigCommerce.

## [Getting Started](#getting-started)

You can either deploy the template below to Vercel or use the following steps to fork and clone it to your machine and deploy it locally.

## [Configure BigCommerce](#configure-bigcommerce)

1.  ### [Set up a BigCommerce account and storefront](#set-up-a-bigcommerce-account-and-storefront)
    
    You can use an existing BigCommerce account and storefront, or get started with one of the options below:
    
    *   [Start a free trial](https://www.bigcommerce.com/start-your-trial/)
    *   [Create a developer sandbox](https://start.bigcommerce.com/developer-sandbox/)
2.  ### [Fork and clone the Catalyst repository](#fork-and-clone-the-catalyst-repository)
    
    1.  [Fork the Catalyst repository on GitHub](https://github.com/bigcommerce/catalyst/fork). You can name your fork as you prefer. This guide will refer to it as `<YOUR_FORK_NAME>`.
    2.  Clone your forked repository to your local machine using the following command:
    
    Terminal
    
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>/<YOUR_FORK_NAME>.git
    cd <YOUR_FORK_NAME>
    ```
    
    Replace `<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>` with your GitHub username and `<YOUR_FORK_NAME>` with the name you chose for your fork.
    
3.  ### [Add the upstream Catalyst repository](#add-the-upstream-catalyst-repository)
    
    To automatically sync updates, add the BigCommerce Catalyst repository as a remote named "upstream" using the following command:
    
    Terminal
    
    ```
    git remote add upstream git@github.com:bigcommerce/catalyst.git
    ```
    
    Verify the local repository is set up with the remote repositories using the following command:
    
    Terminal
    
    ```
    git remote -v
    ```
    
    The output should look similar to this:
    
    Terminal
    
    ```
    origin    git@github.com:<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME><YOUR_FORK_NAME>.git (fetch)
    origin    git@github.com:<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>/<YOUR_FORK_NAME>.git (push)
    upstream  git@github.com:bigcommerce/catalyst.git (fetch)
    upstream  git@github.com:bigcommerce/catalyst.git (push)
    ```
    
    Learn more about [syncing a fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork).
    
4.  ### [Enable Corepack and install dependencies](#enable-corepack-and-install-dependencies)
    
    Catalyst requires pnpm as the Node.js package manager. [Corepack](https://github.com/nodejs/corepack#readme) is a tool that helps manage package manager versions. Run the following command to enable Corepack, activate pnpm, and install dependencies:
    
    Terminal
    
    ```
    corepack enable pnpm && pnpm install
    ```
    
5.  ### [Run the Catalyst CLI command](#run-the-catalyst-cli-command)
    
    The Catalyst CLI (Command Line Interface) is a tool that helps set up and configure your Catalyst project. When run, it will:
    
    1.  Guide you through logging into your BigCommerce store
    2.  Help you create a new or select an existing Catalyst storefront Channel
    3.  Automatically create an `.env.local` file in your project root
    
    To start this process, run the following command:
    
    Terminal
    
    ```
    pnpm create @bigcommerce/catalyst@latest init
    ```
    
    Follow the CLI prompts to complete the setup.
    
6.  ### [Start the development server](#start-the-development-server)
    
    After setting up your Catalyst project and configuring the environment variables, you can start the development server. From your project root, run the following command:
    
    Terminal
    
    ```
    pnpm dev
    ```
    
    Your local storefront should now be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.
    

## [Deploy to Vercel](#deploy-to-vercel)

Now that your Catalyst storefront is configured, let's deploy your project to Vercel.

3.  ### [Create a new Vercel project](#create-a-new-vercel-project)
    
    Visit [https://vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new) to create a new project. You may be prompted to sign in or create a new account.
    
    1.  Find your forked repository in the list.
    2.  Click the Import button next to your repository.
    3.  In the Root Directory section, click the Edit button.
    4.  Select the `core` directory from file tree. Click Continue to confirm your selection.
    5.  Verify that the Framework preset is set to Next.js. If it isn't, select it from the dropdown menu.
    6.  Open the Environment Variables dropdown and paste the contents of your `.env.local` into the form.
    7.  Click the Deploy button to start the deployment process.
4.  ### [Link your Vercel project](#link-your-vercel-project)
    
    To ensure seamless management of deployments and project settings you can link your local development environment with your Vercel project.
    
    If you haven't already, install the Vercel CLI globally with the following command:
    
    Terminal
    
    ```
    pnpm i -g vercel
    ```
    
    This command will prompt you to log in to your Vercel account and link your local project to your existing Vercel project:
    
    Terminal
    
    ```
    vercel link
    ```
    
    Learn more about the [Vercel CLI](/docs/cli).
    

## [Enable Vercel Remote Cache](#enable-vercel-remote-cache)

Vercel Remote Cache optimizes your build process by sharing build outputs across your Vercel team, eliminating redundant tasks. Follow these steps to set up Remote Cache:

3.  ### [Authenticate with Turborepo](#authenticate-with-turborepo)
    
    Run the following command to authenticate the Turborepo CLI with your Vercel account:
    
    Terminal
    
    ```
    npx turbo login
    ```
    
    For SSO-enabled Vercel teams, include your team slug:
    
    Terminal
    
    ```
    npx turbo login --sso-team=team-slug
    ```
    
4.  ### [Link your Remote Cache](#link-your-remote-cache)
    
    To link your project to a team scope and specify who the cache should be shared with, run the following command:
    
    Terminal
    
    ```
    turbo link
    ```
    
    If you run these commands but the owner has [disabled Remote Caching](#enabling-and-disabling-remote-caching-for-your-team) for your team, Turborepo will present you with an error message: "Please contact your account owner to enable Remote Caching on Vercel."
    
5.  ### [Add Remote Cache Signature Key](#add-remote-cache-signature-key)
    
    To securely sign artifacts before uploading them to the Remote Cache, use the following command to add the `TURBO_REMOTE_CACHE_SIGNATURE_KEY` environment variable to your Vercel project:
    
    Terminal
    
    ```
    vercel env add TURBO_REMOTE_CACHE_SIGNATURE_KEY
    ```
    
    When prompted, add the environment variable to Production, Preview, and Development environments. Set the environment variable to a secure random value by running `openssl rand -hex 32` in your Terminal.
    
    Once finished, pull the new environment variable into your local project with the following command:
    
    Terminal
    
    ```
    vercel env pull
    ```

# Vercel and Shopify Integration

Last updated September 24, 2025

[Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/) is an ecommerce platform that allows you to build and manage online storefronts. Shopify does offer themes, but this integration guide will explain how to deploy your own, highly-performant, custom headless storefront using Next.js on Vercel's Frontend Cloud.

This guide uses the [Next.js Commerce template](/templates/next.js/nextjs-commerce) to connect your Shopify store to a Vercel deployment. When you use this template, you'll be automatically prompted to connect your Shopify storefront during deployment.

To finish, the important parts that you need to know are:

*   [Configure Shopify for use as a headless CMS](#configure-shopify)
*   [Deploy your headless storefront on Vercel](#deploy-to-vercel)
*   [Configure environment variables](#configure-environment-variables)

Even if you are not using Next.js Commerce, you can still use this guide as a roadmap to create your own headless Shopify theme.

## [Getting started](#getting-started)

To help you get started, we built a [template](/templates/nextjs/nextjs-commerce) using Next.js, Shopify, and Tailwind CSS.

You can either deploy the template above to Vercel or use the steps below to clone it to your machine and deploy it locally.

## [Configure Shopify](#configure-shopify)

1.  ### [Create a Shopify account and storefront](#create-a-shopify-account-and-storefront)
    
    If you have an existing Shopify account and storefront, you can use it with the rest of these steps.
    
    If you do not have an existing Shopify account and storefront, you'll need to [create one](https://www.shopify.com/signup).
    
    Next.js Commerce will not work with a Shopify Starter plan as it does not allow installation of custom themes, which is required to run as a headless storefront.
    
2.  ### [Install the Shopify Headless theme](#install-the-shopify-headless-theme)
    
    To use Next.js Commerce as your headless Shopify theme, you need to install the [Shopify Headless theme](https://github.com/instantcommerce/shopify-headless-theme). This enables a seamless flow between your headless site on Vercel and your Shopify hosted checkout, order details, links in emails, and more.
    
    Download [Shopify Headless Theme](https://github.com/instantcommerce/shopify-headless-theme).
    
    ![Download the Shopify Headless theme](/vc-ap-vercel-docs/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F7nyt0uhk7sse4zvn.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs-assets%2Fstatic%2Fdocs%2Fintegrations%2Fshopify%2Finstall-headless-theme-1.jpg&w=3840&q=75)
    
    Navigate to `https://[your-shopify-store-subdomain].myshopify.com/admin/themes`, click `Add theme`, and then `Upload zip file`.
    
    ![Upload the Shopify Headless theme to Shopify](/vc-ap-vercel-docs/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F7nyt0uhk7sse4zvn.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs-assets%2Fstatic%2Fdocs%2Fintegrations%2Fshopify%2Finstall-headless-theme-2.jpg&w=3840&q=75)
    
    Select the downloaded zip file from above, and click the green `Upload file` button.
    
    ![Select downloaded Shopify Headless theme and upload file](/vc-ap-vercel-docs/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F7nyt0uhk7sse4zvn.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs-assets%2Fstatic%2Fdocs%2Fintegrations%2Fshopify%2Finstall-headless-theme-3.jpg&w=3840&q=75)
    
    Click `Customize`.
    
    ![Customize the Shopify Headless theme](/vc-ap-vercel-docs/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F7nyt0uhk7sse4zvn.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs-assets%2Fstatic%2Fdocs%2Fintegrations%2Fshopify%2Finstall-headless-theme-4.jpg&w=3840&q=75)
    
    Click `Theme settings` (the paintbrush icon), expand the `STOREFRONT` section, enter your headless store domain, click the gray `Publish` button.
    
    ![Set the headless domain in theme settings](/vc-ap-vercel-docs/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F7nyt0uhk7sse4zvn.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs-assets%2Fstatic%2Fdocs%2Fintegrations%2Fshopify%2Finstall-headless-theme-5.jpg&w=3840&q=75)
    
    Confirm the theme change by clicking the green `Save and publish` button.
    
    ![Confirm save and publish](/vc-ap-vercel-docs/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F7nyt0uhk7sse4zvn.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs-assets%2Fstatic%2Fdocs%2Fintegrations%2Fshopify%2Finstall-headless-theme-6.jpg&w=3840&q=75)
    
    The headless theme should now be your current active theme.
    
    ![Shopify Headless theme is now the current and active theme](/vc-ap-vercel-docs/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F7nyt0uhk7sse4zvn.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs-assets%2Fstatic%2Fdocs%2Fintegrations%2Fshopify%2Finstall-headless-theme-7.jpg&w=3840&q=75)
    
3.  ### [Install the Shopify Headless app](#install-the-shopify-headless-app)
    
    Shopify provides a [Storefront API](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/storefront) which allows you to fetch products, collections, pages, and more for your headless store. By installing the [Headless app](https://apps.shopify.com/headless), you can create an access token that can be used to authenticate requests from your Vercel deployment.
    
    Navigate to `https://[your-shopify-store-subdomain].myshopify.com/admin/settings/apps` and click the green `Shopify App Store` button.
    
    ![Shopify App Store](/vc-ap-vercel-docs/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F7nyt0uhk7sse4zvn.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs-assets%2Fstatic%2Fdocs%2Fintegrations%2Fshopify%2Finstall-headless-app-1.jpg&w=3840&q=75)
    
    Search for `Headless` and click on the `Headless` app.
    
    ![Search and find Headless app](/vc-ap-vercel-docs/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F7nyt0uhk7sse4zvn.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs-assets%2Fstatic%2Fdocs%2Fintegrations%2Fshopify%2Finstall-headless-app-2.jpg&w=3840&q=75)
    
    Click the black `Add app` button.
    
    ![Click add app on Headless app](/vc-ap-vercel-docs/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F7nyt0uhk7sse4zvn.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs-assets%2Fstatic%2Fdocs%2Fintegrations%2Fshopify%2Finstall-headless-app-3.jpg&w=3840&q=75)
    
    Click the green `Add sales channel` button.
    
    ![Click add sales channel button](/vc-ap-vercel-docs/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F7nyt0uhk7sse4zvn.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs-assets%2Fstatic%2Fdocs%2Fintegrations%2Fshopify%2Finstall-headless-app-4.jpg&w=3840&q=75)
    
    Click the green `Create storefront` button.
    
    ![Click create storefront button](/vc-ap-vercel-docs/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F7nyt0uhk7sse4zvn.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs-assets%2Fstatic%2Fdocs%2Fintegrations%2Fshopify%2Finstall-headless-app-5.jpg&w=3840&q=75)
    
    Copy the public access token as it will be used when we [configure environment variables](#configure-environment-variables).
    
    ![Copy the public access token value](/vc-ap-vercel-docs/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F7nyt0uhk7sse4zvn.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs-assets%2Fstatic%2Fdocs%2Fintegrations%2Fshopify%2Finstall-headless-app-6.jpg&w=3840&q=75)
    
    If you need to reference the public access token again, you can navigate to `https://[your-shopify-store-subdomain].myshopify.com/admin/headless_storefronts`.
    
4.  ### [Configure your Shopify branding and design](#configure-your-shopify-branding-and-design)
    
    Even though you're creating a headless store, there are still a few aspects Shopify will control.
    
    *   Checkout
    *   Emails
    *   Order status
    *   Order history

8.  ### [Configure Shopify webhooks](#configure-shopify-webhooks)
    
    Utilizing [Shopify's webhooks](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/webhooks), and listening for select [Shopify webhook event topics](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-rest/2022-04/resources/webhook#event-topics), you can use Next'js [on-demand revalidation](/docs/incremental-static-regeneration) to keep data fetches indefinitely cached until data in the Shopify store changes.
    
    Next.js Commerce is pre-configured to listen for the following Shopify webhook events and automatically revalidate fetches.
    
    *   `collections/create`
    *   `collections/delete`
    *   `collections/update`
    *   `products/create`
    *   `products/delete`
    *   `products/update` (this includes when variants are added, updated, and removed as well as when products are purchased so inventory and out of stocks can be updated)
9.  ### [Create a secret for secure revalidation](#create-a-secret-for-secure-revalidation)
    
    Create your own secret or [generate a random UUID](https://www.uuidgenerator.net/guid).
    
    This secret value will be used when we [configure environment variables](#configure-environment-variables).
    
10.  ### [Configure Shopify webhooks in the Shopify admin](#configure-shopify-webhooks-in-the-shopify-admin)
    
    Navigate to `https://[your-shopify-store-subdomain].myshopify.com/admin/settings/notifications` and add webhooks for all six event topics listed above.
    
    You can add more sets for other preview urls, environments, or local development. Append `?secret=[your-secret]` to each url, where `[your-secret]` is the secret you created above.

### [Using Shopify as a full-featured CMS](#using-shopify-as-a-full-featured-cms)

Next.js Commerce is fully powered by Shopify in every way. All products, collections, pages header and footer menus, and SEO are controlled by Shopify.

#### [Products](#products)

Navigate to `https://[your-shopify-store-subdomain].myshopify.com/admin/products` to mange your products.

*   Only `Active` products are shown. `Draft` products will not be shown until they are marked as `Active`.
*   `Active` products can still be hidden and not seen by navigating the site, by adding a `nextjs-frontend-hidden` tag on the product. This tag will also tell search engines to not index or crawl the product, but the product will still be directly accessible by url. This feature allows "secret" products to only be accessed by people you share the url with.
*   Product options and option combinations are driven from Shopify options and variants. When selecting options on the product detail page, other option and variant combinations will be visually validated and verified for availability, like Amazon does.
*   Products that are `Active` but no quantity remaining will still be displayed on the site, but will be marked as "out of stock". The ability to add the product to the cart is disabled.

#### [Collections](#collections)

Navigate to `https://[your-shopify-store-subdomain].myshopify.com/admin/collections` to manage your collections.

All available collections will show on the search page as filters on the left, with one exception.

Any collection names that start with the word `hidden` will not show up on the headless front end. Next.js Commerce comes pre-configured to look for two hidden collections. Collections were chosen for this over tags so that order of products could be controlled (collections allow for manual ordering).

Create the following collections:

*   `Hidden: Homepage Featured Items` — Products in this collection are displayed in the three featured blocks on the homepage.
*   `Hidden: Homepage Carousel` — Products in this collection are displayed in the auto-scrolling carousel section on the homepage.

![Shopify collections](/vc-ap-vercel-docs/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F7nyt0uhk7sse4zvn.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs-assets%2Fstatic%2Fdocs%2Fintegrations%2Fshopify%2Fcollections-1.jpg&w=3840&q=75)

![Shopify collection details](/vc-ap-vercel-docs/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F7nyt0uhk7sse4zvn.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs-assets%2Fstatic%2Fdocs%2Fintegrations%2Fshopify%2Fcollections-2.jpg&w=3840&q=75)

#### [Pages](#pages)

Navigate to `https://[your-shopify-store-subdomain].myshopify.com/admin/pages` to manage your pages.

Next.js Commerce contains a dynamic `[page]` route. It will use the value to look for a corresponding page in Shopify.

*   If a page is found, it will display its rich content using [Tailwind's typography plugin](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/typography-plugin) and `prose`.
*   If a page is not found, a `404` page is displayed.

![Shopify pages](/vc-ap-vercel-docs/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F7nyt0uhk7sse4zvn.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs-assets%2Fstatic%2Fdocs%2Fintegrations%2Fshopify%2Fpages-2.jpg&w=3840&q=75)

![Shopify page details](/vc-ap-vercel-docs/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F7nyt0uhk7sse4zvn.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs-assets%2Fstatic%2Fdocs%2Fintegrations%2Fshopify%2Fpages-1.jpg&w=3840&q=75)

#### [Navigation menus](#navigation-menus)

`https://[your-shopify-store-subdomain].myshopify.com/admin/menus`

Next.js Commerce's header and footer navigation is pre-configured to be controlled by Shopify navigation menus. They can be to collections, pages, external links, and more, giving you full control of managing what displays.

Create the following navigation menus:

*   `Next.js Frontend Header Menu` — Menu items to be shown in the headless frontend header.
*   `Next.js Frontend Footer Menu` — Menu items to be shown in the headless frontend footer.

![Shopify navigation menus](/vc-ap-vercel-docs/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F7nyt0uhk7sse4zvn.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs-assets%2Fstatic%2Fdocs%2Fintegrations%2Fshopify%2Fnavigation-menus-1.jpg&w=3840&q=75)

#### [SEO](#seo)

Shopify's products, collections, pages, etc. allow you to create custom SEO titles and descriptions. Next.js Commerce is pre-configured to display these custom values, but also comes with sensible fallbacks if they are not provided.

![Shopify SEO](/vc-ap-vercel-docs/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F7nyt0uhk7sse4zvn.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs-assets%2Fstatic%2Fdocs%2Fintegrations%2Fshopify%2Fseo.jpg&w=3840&q=75)

## [Deploy to Vercel](#deploy-to-vercel)

Now that your Shopify store is configured, you can deploy your code to Vercel.

### [Clone the repository](#clone-the-repository)

You can clone the repo using the following command:

pnpmyarnnpmbun

```
pnpm create next-app --example https://github.com/vercel/commerce
```

### [Publish your code](#publish-your-code)

Publish your code to a Git provider like GitHub.

```
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-account/your-repo
git push -u origin main
```

### [Import your project](#import-your-project)

Import the repository into a [new Vercel project](/new).

Vercel will automatically detect you are using Next.js and configure the optimal build settings.

### [Configure environment variables](#configure-environment-variables)

# Integrating Vercel and Kubernetes

Copy page

Ask AI about this page

Last updated September 9, 2025

Kubernetes (K8s) is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It has become a popular and powerful way for companies to manage their applications.

You can integrate Vercel with your existing Kubernetes infrastructure to optimize the delivery of your frontend applications—reducing the number of services your teams need to manage, while still taking advantage of Kubernetes for your backend and other containerized workloads.

Let’s look at key Kubernetes concepts and how Vercel’s [managed infrastructure](/products/managed-infrastructure) handles them:

*   [Server management and provisioning](#server-management-and-provisioning)
*   [Scaling and redundancy](#scaling-and-redundancy)
*   [Managing environments and deployments](#managing-environments-and-deployments)
*   [Managing access and security](#managing-access-and-security)
*   [Observability](#observability)
*   [Integrating Vercel with your Kubernetes backend](#integrating-vercel-with-your-kubernetes-backend)
*   [Before/after comparison: Kubernetes vs. Vercel](#before/after-comparison:-kubernetes-vs.-vercel)
*   [Migrating from Kubernetes to Vercel](#migrating-from-kubernetes-to-vercel)

## [Server management and provisioning](#server-management-and-provisioning)

With Kubernetes, you must define and configure a web server (e.g. Nginx), resources (CPU, memory), and networking (ingress, API Gateway, firewalls) for each of your nodes and clusters.

Vercel manages server provisioning for you. Through [framework-defined infrastructure](/blog/framework-defined-infrastructure) and support for a [wide range of the most popular frontend frameworks](/docs/frameworks), Vercel automatically provisions cloud infrastructure based on your frontend framework code. Vercel also manages every aspect of your [domain](/docs/domains), including generating, assigning, and renewing SSL certificates.

## [Scaling and redundancy](#scaling-and-redundancy)

In a self-managed Kubernetes setup, you manually configure your Kubernetes cluster to scale horizontally (replicas) or vertically (resources). It takes careful planning and monitoring to find the right balance between preventing waste (over-provisioning) and causing unintentional bottlenecks (under-provisioning).

In addition to scaling, you may need to deploy your Kubernetes clusters to multiple regions to improve the availability, disaster recovery, and latency of applications.

Vercel automatically scales your applications based on end-user traffic. Vercel deploys your application globally on our [CDN](/docs/cdn), reducing latency and improving end-user performance. In the event of regional downtime or an upstream outage, Vercel automatically reroutes your traffic to the next closest region, ensuring your applications are always available to your users.

## [Managing environments and deployments](#managing-environments-and-deployments)

Managing the container lifecycle and promoting environments in a self-managed ecosystem typically involves three parts:

*   Containerization (Docker): Packages applications and their dependencies into containers to ensure consistent environments across development, testing, and production.
*   Container orchestration (Kubernetes): Manages containers (often Docker containers) at scale. Handles deployment, scaling, and networking of containerized applications.
*   Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool (Terraform): Provisions and manages the infrastructure (cloud, on-premises, or hybrid) in a consistent and repeatable manner using configuration files.

These parts work together by Docker packaging applications into containers, Kubernetes deploying and managing these containers across a cluster of machines, and Terraform provisioning the underlying infrastructure on which Kubernetes itself runs. An automated or push-button CI/CD process usually facilitates the rollout, warming up pods, performing health checks, and shifting traffic to the new pods.

Vercel knows how to automatically configure your environment through our [framework-defined infrastructure](/blog/framework-defined-infrastructure), removing the need for containerization or manually implementing CI/CD for your frontend workload.

Once you connect a Vercel project to a Git repository, every push to a branch automatically creates a new deployment of your application with [our Git integrations](/docs/git). The default branch (usually `main`) is your production environment. Every time your team pushes to the default branch, Vercel creates a new production deployment. Vercel creates a [Preview Deployment](/docs/deployments/environments#preview-environment-pre-production) when you push to another branch besides the default branch. A Preview Deployment allows your team to test changes and leave feedback using [Preview Comments](/docs/comments) in a live deployment (using a [generated URL](/docs/deployments/generated-urls)) before changes are merged to your Git production branch.

Every deploy is immutable, and these generated domains act as pointers. Reverting and deploying is an atomic swap operation. These infrastructure capabilities enable other Vercel features, like [Instant Rollbacks](/docs/instant-rollback) and [Skew Protection](/docs/skew-protection).

## [Managing access and security](#managing-access-and-security)

In a Kubernetes environment, you need to implement security measures such as Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), network policies, secrets management, and environment variables to protect the cluster and its resources. This often involves configuring access controls, integrating with existing identity providers (if necessary), and setting up user accounts and permissions. Regular maintenance of the Kubernetes environment is needed for security patches, version updates, and dependency management to defend against vulnerabilities.

With Vercel, you can securely configure [environment variables](/docs/environment-variables) and manage [user access, roles, and permissions](/docs/accounts/team-members-and-roles) in the Vercel dashboard. Vercel handles all underlying infrastructure updates and security patches, ensuring your deployment environment is secure and up-to-date.

## [Observability](#observability)

A Kubernetes setup typically uses observability solutions to aid in troubleshooting, alerting, and monitoring of your applications. You could do this through third-party services like Splunk, DataDog, Grafana, and more.

Vercel provides built-in logging and monitoring capabilities through our [observability products](/docs/observability) with real-time logs and built-in traffic analytics. These are all accessible through the Vercel dashboard. If needed, Vercel has [one-click integrations with leading observability platforms](/integrations), so you can keep using your existing tools alongside your Kubernetes-based backend.

## [Integrating Vercel with your Kubernetes backend](#integrating-vercel-with-your-kubernetes-backend)

If you’re running backend services on Kubernetes (e.g., APIs, RPC layers, data processing jobs), you can continue doing so while offloading your frontend to Vercel’s managed infrastructure:

*   Networking: Vercel can securely connect to your Kubernetes-hosted backend services. You can keep your APIs behind load balancers or private networks. For stricter environments, [Vercel Secure Compute](/docs/secure-compute) (available on Enterprise plans) ensures secure, private connectivity to internal services.
*   Environment Variables and Secrets: Your application’s environment variables (e.g., API keys, database credentials) can be configured securely in the [Vercel dashboard](/docs/environment-variables).
*   Observability: You can maintain your existing observability setup for Kubernetes (Grafana, DataDog, etc.) while also leveraging Vercel’s built-in logs and analytics for your frontend.

## [Before/after comparison: Kubernetes vs. Vercel](#before/after-comparison:-kubernetes-vs.-vercel)

Here's how managing frontend infrastructure compares between traditional, self-managed Kubernetes and Vercel's fully managed frontend solution:

| Capability | Kubernetes (Self-managed) | Vercel (Managed) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Server Provisioning | Manual setup of Nginx, Node.js pods, ingress, load balancing, and networking policies | Automatic provisioning based on framework code |
| Autoscaling | Manual configuration required (horizontal/vertical scaling policies) | Fully automatic scaling |
| Availability (Multi-region) | Manually set up multi-region clusters for redundancy and latency | Built-in global CDN |
| Deployment & Rollbacks | Rolling updates can cause downtime (version skew) | Zero downtime deployments and instant rollbacks |
| Runtime & OS Security Patches | Manual and ongoing maintenance | Automatic and managed by Vercel |
| Multi-region Deployment & Failover | Manual setup, configuration, and management | Automatic global deployment and failover |
| Version Skew Protection | Manual rolling deployments (possible downtime) | Built-in Skew Protection |
| Observability & Logging | Requires third-party setup (Grafana, Splunk, DataDog) | Built-in observability and one-click integrations |
| CI/CD & Deployment Management | Requires integration of multiple tools (Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, CI/CD pipelines) | Built-in Git-integrated CI/CD system |

By migrating just your frontend to Vercel, you drastically reduce the operational overhead of managing and scaling web servers, pods, load balancers, ingress controllers, and more.

## [Migrating from Kubernetes to Vercel](#migrating-from-kubernetes-to-vercel)

To incrementally move your frontend applications to Vercel:

1.  ### [Create a Vercel account and team](#create-a-vercel-account-and-team)
    
    Start by [creating a Vercel account](/signup) and [team](/docs/accounts/create-a-team), if needed.
    
2.  ### [Create two versions of your frontend codebase](#create-two-versions-of-your-frontend-codebase)
    
    Keep your current frontend running in Kubernetes for now. Create a fork or a branch of your frontend codebase and connect it to a [new Vercel project](/docs/projects/overview#creating-a-project).
    
    Once connected, Vercel will automatically build and deploy your application. It’s okay if the first deployment fails. [View the build logs](/docs/deployments/logs) and [troubleshoot the build](/docs/deployments/troubleshoot-a-build) failures. Changes might include:
    
    *   Adjustments to build scripts
    *   Changes to the [project configuration](/docs/project-configuration)
    *   Missing [environment variables](/docs/environment-variables)
    
    Continue addressing errors until you get a successful Preview Deployment.
    
    Depending on how you have your Kubernetes environment configured, you may need to adjust firewall and security policies to allow the applications to talk to each other. Vercel [provides some options](/guides/how-to-allowlist-deployment-ip-address), including [Vercel Secure Compute](/docs/secure-compute) for Enterprise teams, which allows you to establish secure connections between Vercel and backend environments.
    
    The goal is to use the Preview Deployment to test the integration with your Kubernetes-hosted backends, ensuring that API calls and data flow work as expected.
    
3.  ### [Set up users and integrations](#set-up-users-and-integrations)
    
    Use [Vercel’s dashboard](/dashboard) to securely manage [user access, roles, and permissions](/docs/accounts/team-members-and-roles), so your team can collaborate on the project.
    
    *   [Add team members and assign roles](/docs/rbac/managing-team-members#adding-team-members-and-assigning-roles) ([SAML SSO](/docs/saml) is available on [Enterprise plans](/docs/plans/enterprise))
    *   [Add integrations](/integrations) to any existing services and tools your team uses
4.  ### [Begin a full or gradual rollout](#begin-a-full-or-gradual-rollout)
    
    Once your preview deployment is passing all tests, and your team is happy with it, you can start to roll it out.
    
    We recommend following our [incremental migration guide](/docs/incremental-migration/migration-guide) or our [Vercel Adoption](/resources/the-architects-guide-to-adopting-vercel) guide to help you serve traffic to a Vercel-hosted frontend for any new paths and seamlessly fallback to your existing server for any old paths.
    
    Some other tools or strategies you may want to use:
    
    *   [Feature Flags on Vercel](/docs/feature-flags)
    *   [A/B Testing on Vercel](/guides/ab-testing-on-vercel)
    *   [Implementing Blue-Green Deployments on Vercel](/guides/blue_green_deployments_on_vercel)
    *   [Transferring Domains to Vercel](/guides/transferring-domains-to-vercel)
    *   [How to migrate a site to Vercel without downtime](/guides/zero-downtime-migration)
5.  ### [Maintain the backend on Kubernetes](#maintain-the-backend-on-kubernetes)
    
    Continue running your backend services on Kubernetes, taking advantage of its strengths in container orchestration for applications your company may not want to move or are unable to move. Examples could include:
    
    *   APIs
    *   Remote Procedure Calls (RPC)
    *   Change Data Captures (CDC)
    *   Extract Transfer Loads (ETL)
    
    Over time, you can evaluate whether specific backend services could also benefit from a serverless architecture and be migrated to Vercel.
    
6.  ### [Accelerate frontend iteration velocity on Vercel](#accelerate-frontend-iteration-velocity-on-vercel)
    
    With Vercel, your development processes become simpler and faster. Vercel combines all the tools you need for CI/CD, staging, testing, feedback, and QA into one streamlined [developer experience platform](/products/dx-platform) to optimize the delivery of high-quality frontend applications. Instant deployments, live previews, and comments accelerate your feedback cycle, while uniform testing environments ensure the quality of your work—letting you focus on what you do best: Building top-notch frontend applications.
    
    A [recent study](/roi) found Vercel customers see:
    
    *   Up to 90% increase in site performance
    *   Up to 80% reduction in time spent deploying
    *   Up to 4x faster time to market

## [Confirming Permission Changes](#confirming-permission-changes)

Integrations can request more permissions over time. Individual users and team owners are [notified](/docs/notifications#notification-details) by Vercel when an integration installation has pending permission changes. You'll also be alerted to any new permissions on the [dashboard](/dashboard/marketplace). The permission request contains information on which permissions are changing and the reasoning behind the changes.

![Changed Permissions on Integration.](/vc-ap-vercel-docs/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F7nyt0uhk7sse4zvn.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs-assets%2Fstatic%2Fdocs%2Fintegrations%2Fdashboard%2Faction-required-for-changed-permissions-light.png&w=1920&q=75)![Changed Permissions on Integration.](/vc-ap-vercel-docs/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F7nyt0uhk7sse4zvn.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs-assets%2Fstatic%2Fdocs%2Fintegrations%2Fdashboard%2Faction-required-for-changed-permissions-dark.png&w=1920&q=75)

Changed Permissions on Integration.

## [Manage project access](#manage-project-access)

To manage which projects the installed integration has access to:

1.  From your Vercel [dashboard](/dashboard), go to the Integrations tab.
2.  Next to the integration, select the Manage button.
3.  On the Integrations page, under Access, select the Manage Access button.
4.  From the dialog, select the option to manage which projects have access.

### [Disabled integrations](#disabled-integrations)

Every integration installed for a team creates an access token that is associated with the developer who originally installed it. If the developer loses access to the team, the integration will become disabled to prevent unauthorized access. We will [notify](/docs/notifications#notification-details) team owners when an installation becomes disabled.

When an integration is disabled, team owners must take action by clicking Manage and either changing ownership or removing the integration.

If a disabled integration is not re-enabled, it will be automatically removed after 30 days. Any environment variables that were created by that integration will also be removed - this may prevent new deployments from working.

When an integration is `disabled`:

*   The integration will no longer have API access to your team or account
*   If the integration has set up log drains, then logs will cease to flow
*   The integration will no longer receive the majority of webhooks, other than those essential to its operation (`project.created`, `project.removed` and `integration-configuration.removed`)

If you are an integrator, see the [disabled integration configurations](/docs/rest-api/vercel-api-integrations#disabled-integration-configurations) documentation to make sure your integration can handle `disabled` state.

# Add a Native Integration

Copy page

Ask AI about this page

Last updated September 4, 2025

Native Integrations are available on [all plans](/docs/plans)

All plans, including Enterprise, can install the integrations through a self-service workflow.

## [Add a product](#add-a-product)

1.  From the [Vercel dashboard](/dashboard), select the Integrations tab and then the Browse Marketplace button. You can also go directly to the [Integrations Marketplace](https://vercel.com/integrations).
2.  Under the Native Integrations section, select an integration that you would like to install. You can see the details of the integration, the products available, and the pricing plans for each product.
3.  From the integration's detail page, select Install.
4.  Review the dialog showing the products available for this integration and a summary of the billing plans for each. Select Install.
5.  Then, select a pricing plan option and select Continue. The specific options available in this step depend on the type of product and the integration provider. For example, for a storage database product, you may need to select a Region for your database deployment before you can select a plan. For an AI service, you may need to select a pre-payment billing plan.
6.  Provide additional information in the next step like Database Name. Review the details and select Create. Once the integration has been installed, you are taken to the tab for this type of integration in the Vercel dashboard. For example, for a storage product, it will be the Storage tab. You will see the details about the database, the pricing plan and how to connect it to your project.

## [Manage native integrations](#manage-native-integrations)

Once installed, you can manage the following aspect of the native integration:

*   View the installed resources (instances of products) and then manage each resource.
*   Connect project(s) to a provisioned resource. For products supporting Log Drains, you can enable them and configure which log sources to forward and the sampling rate.
*   View the invoices and usage for each of your provisioned resources in that installation.
*   [Uninstall the integration](/docs/integrations/install-an-integration/product-integration#uninstall-an-integration)

### [Manage products](#manage-products)

To manage products inside the installed integration:

1.  From your Vercel [dashboard](/dashboard), go to the Integrations tab.
2.  Next to the integration, select the Manage button. Native integrations appear with a `billable` badge.
3.  On the Integrations page, under Installed Products, select the card for the product you would like to update to be taken to the product's detail page.

#### [Projects](#projects)

By selecting the Projects link on the left navigation, you can:

*   Connect a project to the product
*   View a list of existing connections and manage them

#### [Settings](#settings)

By selecting the Settings link on the left navigation, you can update the following:

*   Product name
*   Manage funds: if you selected a prepaid plan for the product, you can Add funds and manage auto recharge settings
*   Delete the product

#### [Getting Started](#getting-started)

By selecting the Getting Started link on the left navigation, you can view quick steps with sample code on how to use the product in your project.

#### [Usage](#usage)

By selecting the Usage link on the left navigation, you can view a graph of the funds used over time by this product in all the projects where it was installed.

#### [Resources](#resources)

Under Resources on the left navigation, you can view a list of links which vary depending on the provider for support, guides and additional resources to help you use the product.

### [Add more products](#add-more-products)

To add more products to this integration:

1.  From your Vercel [dashboard](/dashboard), go to the Integrations tab.
2.  Next to the integration, select the Manage button. Native integrations appear with a `billable` badge.
3.  On the Integrations page, under More Products, select the Install button for the any additional products in that integration that you want to use.

### [Uninstall an integration](#uninstall-an-integration)

Uninstalling an integration automatically removes all associated products and their data.

1.  From your Vercel [dashboard](/dashboard), go to the Integrations tab.
2.  Next to the integration, select the Manage button.
3.  At the bottom of the integrations page, under Uninstall, select Uninstall Integration and follow the steps to uninstall.

## [Use deployment integration actions](#use-deployment-integration-actions)

If available in the integration you want to install, [deployment integration actions](/docs/integrations/create-integration/deployment-integration-action) enable automatic task execution during deployment, such as branching a database or setting environment variables.

1.  Navigate to the integration and use Install Product or use an existing provisioned resource.
2.  Open the Projects tab for the provisioned resource, click Connect Project and select the project for which to configure deployment actions.
3.  When you create a deployment (with a Git pull request or the Vercel CLI), the configured actions will execute automatically.

## [Best practices](#best-practices)

*   Plan your product strategy: Decide whether you need separate products for different projects or environments:
    *   Single resource strategy: For example, a small startup can use a single storage instance for all their Vercel projects to simplify management.
    *   Per-project resources strategy: For example, an enterprise with multiple product lines can use separate storage instances for each project for better performance and security.
    *   Environment-specific resources strategy: For example, a company can use different storage instances for each environment to ensure data integrity.
*   Monitor Usage: Take advantage of per-product usage tracking to optimize costs and performance by using the Usage and Invoices tabs of the [product's settings page](/docs/integrations/install-an-integration/product-integration#manage-products).

# Building Integrations with Vercel REST API

Copy page

Ask AI about this page

Last updated September 24, 2025

## [Using the Vercel REST API](#using-the-vercel-rest-api)

See the following API reference documentation for how to use Vercel REST API to create integrations:

*   [Creating a Project Environment Variable](/docs/rest-api/reference/endpoints/projects/create-one-or-more-environment-variables)
*   [Forwarding Logs using Log Drains](/docs/drains/reference/logs)
*   [Create an Access Token](/docs/rest-api/vercel-api-integrations#create-an-access-token)
*   [Interacting with Teams](/docs/rest-api/vercel-api-integrations#interacting-with-teams)
*   [Interacting with Configurations](/docs/rest-api/vercel-api-integrations#interacting-with-configurations)
*   [Interacting with Vercel Projects](/docs/rest-api/vercel-api-integrations#interacting-with-vercel-projects)

### [Create an Access Token](#create-an-access-token)

To use Vercel REST API, you need to authenticate with an [access token](/docs/rest-api/reference/welcome#authentication) that contains the necessary [scope](#scopes). You can then provide the API token through the [`Authorization` header](/docs/rest-api#authentication).

#### [Exchange `code` for Access Token](#exchange-code-for-access-token)

When you create an integration, you define a [redirect URL](/docs/integrations/create-integration/submit-integration#redirect-url) that can have query parameters attached.

One of these parameters is the `code` parameter. This short-lived parameter is valid for 30 minutes and can be exchanged once for a long-lived access token using the following API endpoint:

terminal

```
{`POST https://api.vercel.com/v2/oauth/access_token`}
```

Pass the following values to the request body in the form of `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.

| Key | [Type](#api-basics/types) | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| client\_id | [ID](#api-basics/types) | Yes | ID of your application. |
| client\_secret | [String](#api-basics/types) | Yes | Secret of your application. |
| code | [String](#api-basics/types) | Yes | The code you received. |
| redirect\_uri | [String](#api-basics/types) | Yes | The Redirect URL you configured on the Integration Console. |

#### [Example Request](#example-request)

Show More

### [Interacting with Teams](#interacting-with-teams)

The response of your `code` exchange request includes a `team_id` property. If `team_id` is not null, you know that this integration was installed on a team.

If your integration is installed on a team, append the `teamId` query parameter to each API request. See [Accessing Resources Owned by a Team](/docs/rest-api#accessing-resources-owned-by-a-team) for more details.

### [Interacting with Configurations](#interacting-with-configurations)

Each installation of your integration is stored and tracked as a configuration.

Sometimes it makes sense to fetch the configuration in order to get more insights about the current scope or the projects your integration has access to.

To see which endpoints are available, see the [Configurations](/docs/project-configuration) documentation for more details.

#### [Disabled Integration Configurations](#disabled-integration-configurations)

If an owner(s) of an integration leaves the team that's responsible for the integration, the integration will be flagged as disabled. The team will receive an email to take action (transfer ownership) within 30 days, otherwise the integration will be deleted.

When integration configurations are disabled:

*   Any API requests will fail with a `403` HTTP status code and a `code` of `integration_configuration_disabled`
*   We continue to send `project.created`, `project.removed` and `integration-configuration.removed` webhooks, as these will allow the integration configuration to operate correctly when re-activated. All other webhook delivery will be paused
*   Log drains will not receive any logs

### [Interacting with Vercel Projects](#interacting-with-vercel-projects)

Deployments made with Vercel are grouped into Projects. This means that each deployment is assigned a name and is grouped into a project with other deployments using that same name.

Using the Vercel REST API, you can modify Projects that the Integration has access to. Here are some examples:

### [Modifying Environment Variables on a Project](#modifying-environment-variables-on-a-project)

When building a Vercel Integration, you may want to expose an API token or a configuration URL for deployments within a [Project](/docs/projects/overview).

You can do so by [Creating a Project Environment Variable](/docs/rest-api/reference/endpoints/projects/create-one-or-more-environment-variables) using the API.

Environment Variables created by an Integration will

[

display the Integration's logo

](/docs/environment-variables#integration-environment-variables)

.

## [Scopes](#scopes)

When creating integrations the following scopes can be updated within the Integration Console:

Write permissions are required for both `project` and `domain` when updating the domain of a project.

| Scope | Description |
| --- | --- |
| integration-configuration | Interact with the installation of your integration |
| deployment | Interact with deployments |
| deployment-check | Verify deployments with Checks |
| edge-config | Create and manage Edge Configs and their tokens |
| project | Access project details and settings |
| project-env-vars | Create and manage integration-owned project environment variables |
| global-project-env-vars | Create and manage all account project environment variables |
| team | Access team details |
| user | Get information about the current user |
| log-drain | Create and manage log drains to forward logs |
| domain | Manage and interact with domains and certificates. Write permissions are required for both `project` and `domain` when updating the domain of a project. |

### [Updating Scopes](#updating-scopes)

As the Vercel REST API evolves, you'll need to update your scopes based on your integration's endpoint usage.

![Confirming Scope changes.](/vc-ap-vercel-docs/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F7nyt0uhk7sse4zvn.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs-assets%2Fstatic%2Fdocs%2Fintegrations%2Fconsole%2Fconfirm-scope-change.png&w=3840&q=75)![Confirming Scope changes.](/vc-ap-vercel-docs/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F7nyt0uhk7sse4zvn.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs-assets%2Fstatic%2Fdocs%2Fintegrations%2Fconsole%2Fconfirm-scope-change-dark.png&w=3840&q=75)

Confirming Scope changes.

Additions and upgrades always require a review and confirmation. To ensure this, every affected user and team owner will be informed through email to undergo this process. Please make sure you provide a meaningful, short, and descriptive note for your changes.

Scope removals and downgrades won't require user confirmation and will be applied immediately to confirmed scopes and pending requested scope changes.

### [Confirmed Scope Changes](#confirmed-scope-changes)

User and Teams will always confirm all pending changes with one confirmation. That means that if you have requested new scopes multiple times over the past year, the users will see a summary of all pending changes with their respective provided note.

Once a user confirms these changes, scopes get directly applied to the installation. You will also get notified through the new `integration-configuration.scope-change-confirmed` event.

## [Common Errors](#common-errors)

When using the Vercel REST API with Integrations, you might come across some errors which you can address immediately.

### [CORS issues](#cors-issues)

To avoid CORS issues, make sure you only interact with the Vercel REST API on the server side.

Since the token grants access to resources of the Team or Personal Account, you should never expose it on the client side.

For more information on using CORS with Vercel, see [How can I enable CORS on Vercel?](/guides/how-to-enable-cors).

### [403 Forbidden responses](#403-forbidden-responses)

Ensure you are not missing the `teamId` [query parameter](/docs/integrations/create-integration/submit-integration#redirect-url). `teamId` is required if the integration installation is for a Team. Ensure the Scope of Your [Access Token](/docs/rest-api/vercel-api-integrations#using-the-vercel-api/scopes/teams) is properly set.
