# Sales Tax

Copy page

Ask AI about this page

Last updated September 24, 2025

### [Do you charge sales tax on your services?](#do-you-charge-sales-tax-on-your-services)

Yes. Beginning November 1, 2025, we will start collecting sales tax for US-based customers on all Vercel products and services where required by law. The exact amount depends on your billing address and applicable tax regulations.

### [Why are you starting to collect sales tax now?](#why-are-you-starting-to-collect-sales-tax-now)

State regulations now require cloud service providers to collect sales tax in many jurisdictions. We're updating our billing practices effective November 1, 2025 to ensure full compliance.

### [Will all customers be charged sales tax?](#will-all-customers-be-charged-sales-tax)

Not necessarily. Sales tax is only charged in states where Vercel is registered to collect tax. If your billing address is in one of those jurisdictions, you will see sales tax added to your invoices. If not, you will not be charged tax.

### [How will sales tax appear on my invoice?](#how-will-sales-tax-appear-on-my-invoice)

Invoices will now show a separate line item for sales tax, clearly indicating the amount charged in addition to the products and services purchased.

### [Do I need to take any action regarding sales tax?](#do-i-need-to-take-any-action-regarding-sales-tax)

For most customers, no action is required. Sales tax will automatically be calculated and added to your invoice based on your billing information. However, if your organization is tax-exempt, you’ll need to provide us with a valid exemption certificate.

### [What if my organization is tax-exempt?](#what-if-my-organization-is-tax-exempt)

If you qualify for tax exemption, please send your exemption certificate to [tax@vercel.com](mailto:tax@vercel.com). Once verified by our team, your account will be marked as tax-exempt, and sales tax will not be applied to your invoices.

### [Are international customers charged any additional fees or taxes?](#are-international-customers-charged-any-additional-fees-or-taxes)

For international customers, we will begin collecting VAT, GST, or similar taxes where required by law in the near future. We will communicate in advance about this change.

### [When will US customers start being charged for sales tax?](#when-will-us-customers-start-being-charged-for-sales-tax)

Sales tax collection for US-based customers will begin on November 1, 2025. All invoices issued on or after that date will include applicable sales tax.

### [Where can I find more information about Vercel’s terms of service about tax?](#where-can-i-find-more-information-about-vercel’s-terms-of-service-about-tax)

You can refer to our [terms of service](/legal/terms#payments) on collecting sales tax.

### [Who can I contact with tax-related questions?](#who-can-i-contact-with-tax-related-questions)

If you have specific questions about tax collection or exemptions, please contact our team at [tax@vercel.com](mailto:tax@vercel.com).

# Billing & Invoices

Last updated September 24, 2025

You can view your current invoice from the Settings tab of your [dashboard](/dashboard) in two ways:

*   By navigating to the Billing tab of the dashboard
*   Or selecting the latest entry in the list of invoices on the Invoices tab.

## [Understanding your invoice](#understanding-your-invoice)

Your invoice is a breakdown of the charges you have incurred for the current billing cycle. It includes the total amount due, the billing period, and a detailed breakdown of both metered and on-demand charges depending on your plan.

![Invoice overview](/vc-ap-vercel-docs/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F7nyt0uhk7sse4zvn.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Ffront%2Fdocs%2Fpricing%2Ffull-invoice-light.png&w=1920&q=75)![Invoice overview](/vc-ap-vercel-docs/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F7nyt0uhk7sse4zvn.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Ffront%2Fdocs%2Fpricing%2Ffull-invoice-dark.png&w=1920&q=75)

Invoice overview

When you access your invoice through the Invoice tab:

*   You can choose to download the invoice as a PDF through selecting the icon on the invoice row
*   You can select an invoice to view the detailed breakdown of the charges. Each invoice includes an invoice number, the date issued, and the due date

### [Pro plan invoices](#pro-plan-invoices)

Pro plan users receive invoices based on on-demand usage. Each feature under [Managed Infrastructure](/docs/pricing#managed-infrastructure-billable-resources) includes:

*   A specific usage allotment. Charges incur on-demand when you exceed the usage allotment
*   [Managed Infrastructure](/docs/pricing#managed-infrastructure-billable-resources) charges get metered and billed on a monthly basis
*   [Developer Experience Platform](/docs/pricing#dx-platform-billable-resources) features get billed at fixed prices when purchased, and can include monthly or one-time charges

When viewing an invoice, Pro plan users will see a section called [On-demand Charges](#pro-plan-on-demand-charges). This section has two categories: [Managed Infrastructure](/docs/pricing#managed-infrastructure) and [Developer Experience Platform](/docs/pricing#developer-experience-platform).

#### [Pro plan on-demand charges](#pro-plan-on-demand-charges)

For Pro plan users, on-demand charges incur in two ways. Either when you exceed the usage allotment for a specific feature under [Managed Infrastructure](/docs/pricing#managed-infrastructure-billable-resources). Or when you purchase a product from [Developer Experience Platform](/docs/pricing#dx-platform-billable-resources) during the period of the invoice.

![Pro plan invoice with on-demand charges](/vc-ap-vercel-docs/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F7nyt0uhk7sse4zvn.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Ffront%2Fdocs%2Fpricing%2Fpro-plan-invoice-light.jpg&w=1920&q=75)![Pro plan invoice with on-demand charges](/vc-ap-vercel-docs/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F7nyt0uhk7sse4zvn.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Ffront%2Fdocs%2Fpricing%2Fpro-plan-invoice-dark.jpg&w=1920&q=75)

Pro plan invoice with on-demand charges

### [Enterprise plan invoices](#enterprise-plan-invoices)

Enterprise customer's invoicing gets tailored around a flexible usage model. It's based on a periodic commitment to [Managed Infrastructure Units (MIU)](#managed-infrastructure-units-miu).

The top of the invoice shows a summary of the commitment period, the total MIUs committed, and the current usage towards that commitment. If the commitment has been exceeded, the on-demand charges will be listed under the [On-demand Charges](#enterprise-on-demand-charges) section.

#### [Managed Infrastructure Units (MIU)](#managed-infrastructure-units-miu)

MIUs are a measure of the infrastructure consumption of an Enterprise project. These consist of a variety of resources like [Fast Data Transfer, Edge Requests, and more](/docs/pricing#managed-infrastructure-billable-resources).

#### [Enterprise on-demand charges](#enterprise-on-demand-charges)

When Enterprise customers exceed their commitment for a period, they will see individual line items for the on-demand amount under the On-demand Charges section. This is the same as for Pro plan users.

![Enterprise plan invoice with Managed Infrastructure Units commitment and on-demand charges](/vc-ap-vercel-docs/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F7nyt0uhk7sse4zvn.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Ffront%2Fdocs%2Fpricing%2Fent-on-demand-light.jpg&w=2048&q=75)![Enterprise plan invoice with Managed Infrastructure Units commitment and on-demand charges](/vc-ap-vercel-docs/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F7nyt0uhk7sse4zvn.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Ffront%2Fdocs%2Fpricing%2Fent-on-demand-dark.jpg&w=2048&q=75)

# Working with Vercel's private registry

Copy page

Ask AI about this page

Last updated September 24, 2025

Vercel distributes packages with the `@vercel-private` scope through our private npm registry, requiring authentication through a Vercel account for each user.

This guide covers Vercel's private registry packages. For information on using your own private npm packages with Vercel, see our guide on [using private dependencies with Vercel](https://vercel.com/guides/using-private-dependencies-with-vercel).

Access to `@vercel-private` packages is linked to access to products. If you have trouble accessing a package, please check that you have access to the corresponding Vercel product.

## [Setting up your local environment](#setting-up-your-local-environment)

1.  ### [Set up your workspace](#set-up-your-workspace)
    
    If you're the first person on your team to use Vercel's private registry, you'll need to set up your workspace to fetch packages from the private registry.
    
    Execute the following command to configure your package manager to fetch packages with the `@vercel-private` scope from the private registry. Note that you can run this command with any package manager, such as `npm`, `yarn`, or `pnpm`. If you're using modern Yarn (v2 or newer) see the [Using modern versions of Yarn](#setting-registry-server-using-modern-versions-of-yarn) section below.
    
    ```
    npm config set --location=project @vercel-private:registry "https://vercel-private-registry.vercel.sh/registry"
    ```
    
    This command creates an `.npmrc` file (or updates one if it exists) at the root of your workspace. We recommend committing this file to your repository, as it will help other engineers get on board faster.
    
2.  ### [Setting registry server using modern versions of Yarn](#setting-registry-server-using-modern-versions-of-yarn)
    
    Yarn version 2 or newer ignores the `.npmrc` config file so you will need to use this command instead to add the registry to your project's `.yarnrc.yml` file:
    
    ```
    yarn config set npmScopes.vercel-private.npmRegistryServer "https://vercel-private-registry.vercel.sh/registry"
    ```
    
3.  ### [Log in to the private registry](#log-in-to-the-private-registry)
    
    Each team member will need to complete this step. It may be helpful to summarize this step in your team's onboarding documentation.
    
    To log in, use the following command and follow the prompts:
    
    ```
    npm login --scope=@vercel-private
    ```
    
    The minimum required version of npm to log into the registry is 8.14.0
    
    During this process, you will be asked to log in to your Vercel account. Ensure that the account that you log in to has access to the Vercel product(s) that you're trying to install.
    
    You should now have a `.npmrc` file in your home directory that contains the authentication token for the private registry.
    
4.  #### [Setting token using modern versions of Yarn](#setting-token-using-modern-versions-of-yarn)
    
    Yarn version 2 or newer requires the authentication token to be saved in a `.yarnrc.yml` file. After running the above command, you can copy the token from the `.npmrc` file with:
    
    ```
    auth_token=$(awk -F'=' '/vercel-private-registry.vercel.sh\/:_authToken/ {print $2}' $(npm config get userconfig)) \
    && yarn config set --home 'npmRegistries["https://vercel-private-registry.vercel.sh/registry"].npmAuthToken' $auth_token
    ```
    
    Note the `--home` flag, which ensures the token is saved in the global `.yarnrc.yml` rather then in your project so that it isn't committed.
    
5.  ### [Verify your setup](#verify-your-setup)
    
    Verify your login status by executing:
    
    pnpmyarnnpmbun
    
    ```
    pnpm whoami --registry=https://vercel-private-registry.vercel.sh/registry
    ```
    
    The Yarn command only works with Yarn version 2 or newer, use the npm command if using Yarn v1.
    
    You should see your Vercel username returned if everything is set up correctly.
    
6.  ### [Optionally set up a pre-install message for missing credentials](#optionally-set-up-a-pre-install-message-for-missing-credentials)
    
    When a user tries to install a package from the private registry without first logging in, the error message might be unclear. To help, we suggest adding a pre-install message that provides instructions to those unauthenticated users.
    
    Create a `preinstall.mjs` file with your error message:
    
    preinstall.mjs
    
    ```
    import { exec } from 'node:child_process';
    import { promisify } from 'node:util';
     
    const execPromise = promisify(exec);
     
    try {
      await execPromise(
        `npm whoami --registry=https://vercel-private-registry.vercel.sh/registry`,
      );
    } catch (error) {
      throw new Error(
        `Please log in to the Vercel private registry to install \`@vercel-private\`-scoped packages:\n\`npm login --scope=@vercel-private\``,
      );
    }
    ```
    
    Then add the following script to the `scripts` field in your `package.json`:
    
    pnpmyarnnpmbun
    
    ```
    {
      "scripts": {
        "pnpm:devPreinstall": "node preinstall.mjs"
      }
    }
    ```
    

## [Setting up Vercel](#setting-up-vercel)

Now that your local environment is set up, you can configure Vercel to use the private registry.

1.  Create a [Vercel authentication token](/docs/rest-api#creating-an-access-token) on the [Tokens](https://vercel.com/account/tokens) page
2.  To set the newly created token in Vercel, navigate to the [Environment Variables](https://vercel.com/docs/environment-variables) settings for your Project
3.  Add a new environment variable with the name `VERCEL_TOKEN`, and set the value to the token you created above. We recommend using a [Sensitive Environmental Variable](/docs/environment-variables/sensitive-environment-variables) for storing this token
4.  Add a new environment variable with the name `NPM_RC`, and set the value to the following:

```
@vercel-private:registry=https://vercel-private-registry.vercel.sh/registry
//vercel-private-registry.vercel.sh/:_authToken=${VERCEL_TOKEN}
```

If you already have an `NPM_RC` environment variable, you can append the above to that existing value.

Vercel should now be able to install packages from the private registry when building your Project.

## [Setting up your CI provider](#setting-up-your-ci-provider)

The instructions below are for [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions), but configuring other CI providers should be similar:

1.  Create a [Vercel authentication token](/docs/rest-api#creating-an-access-token) on the [Tokens](https://vercel.com/account/tokens) page. For security reasons, you should use a different token from the one you created for Vercel in the previous step
2.  Once you have a new token, add it as a secret named `VERCEL_TOKEN` to your GitHub repository or organization. To learn more about how to add secrets, [Using secrets in GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions)
3.  Finally, create a [workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows) for the product you're setting up. The example workflow below is for [Conformance](/docs/conformance) and assumes that you're using [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) as your package manager. In this example we also pass the token to the Conformance CLI, as the same token can be used for CLI authentication

.github/workflows/conformance.yml

```
name: Conformance
 
on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main
 
jobs:
  conformance:
    name: 'Run Conformance'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
 
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version-file: '.node-version'
 
      - name: Set up pnpm
        uses: pnpm/action-setup@v3
 
      - name: Set up Vercel private registry
        run: npm config set //vercel-private-registry.vercel.sh/:_authToken $VERCEL_TOKEN
        env:
          VERCEL_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}
 
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pnpm install
 
      - name: Run Conformance
        run: pnpm conformance
        env:
          VERCEL_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}
```

By default, GitHub workflows are not required. To require the workflow in your repository, [create a branch protection rule on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/managing-a-branch-protection-rule#creating-a-branch-protection-rule) to Require status checks to pass before merging.

Last updated September 23, 2025

When launching your application on Vercel, it is important to ensure that it's ready for production. This checklist is prepared by the Vercel engineering team and designed to help you prepare your application for launch by running through a series of questions to ensure:

*   [Operational excellence](#operational-excellence)
*   [Security](#security)
*   [Reliability](#reliability)
*   [Performance efficiency](#performance)
*   [Cost optimization](#cost-optimization).

## [Operational excellence](#operational-excellence)

*   Define an incident response plan for your team, including [escalation paths](/help#issues), [communication channels](https://www.vercel-status.com), and [rollback strategies](/docs/instant-rollback) for deployments
    
*   Familiarize yourself with how to [stage, promote and rollback](/docs/deployments/managing-deployments) deployments
    
*   Ensure [caching](/docs/monorepos/turborepo) is configured if deploying using a monorepo to prevent unnecessary builds
    
*   Perform a zero downtime migration to [Vercel DNS](/guides/zero-downtime-migration-for-dns)
    

## [Security](#security)

*   Implement a [Content Security Policy](/guides/content-security-policy) (CSP) and proper [security headers](/docs/conformance/rules/NEXTJS_MISSING_SECURITY_HEADERS)
    
*   Enable [Deployment Protection](/docs/security/deployment-protection) to prevent unauthorized access to your deployments
    
*   Configure the [Vercel Web Application Firewall (WAF)](/docs/security/vercel-waf) to monitor, block, and challenge incoming traffic. This includes setting up [custom rules](/docs/security/vercel-waf/custom-rules), [IP blocking](/docs/security/vercel-waf/ip-blocking), and enabling [managed rulesets](/docs/security/vercel-waf/managed-rulesets) for enhanced security
    
*   Enable [Log Drains](/docs/drains) to persist logs from your deployments
    
*   Review common [SSL certificate issues](/docs/domains/troubleshooting#common-ssl-certificate-issues)
    
*   Enable a [Preview Deployment Suffix](/docs/deployments/generated-urls#preview-deployment-suffix) to use a [custom domain](/docs/domains/add-a-domain) for Preview Deployments
    
*   Commit your [lockfiles](/docs/package-managers) to pin dependencies and speed up builds through caching
    
*   Consider implementing [rate limiting](/docs/vercel-firewall/vercel-waf/rate-limiting) to prevent abuse
    
*   Review and implement [access roles](/docs/rbac/access-roles) to ensure the correct permissions are set for your team members
    
*   Enable [SAML SSO](/docs/saml) and [SCIM](/docs/saml#de-provisioning-team-members) _([Enterprise](/docs/plans/enterprise) plans with [Owner](/docs/rbac/access-roles#owner-role) role only)_
    
*   Enable [Audit Logs](/docs/observability/audit-log) to track and analyze team member activity _([Enterprise](/docs/plans/enterprise) plans with [Owner](/docs/rbac/access-roles#owner-role) role only)_
    
*   Ensure that cookies comply with the [allowed cookie policy](/docs/conformance/rules/SET_COOKIE_VALIDATION) to enhance security. _([Enterprise](/docs/plans/enterprise) plans with [Owner](/docs/rbac/access-roles#owner-role) role only)_
    
*   Setup a firewall rule to [block requests from unwanted

# Configuring projects with vercel.json

Copy page

Ask AI about this page

Last updated October 27, 2025

The `vercel.json` file lets you configure, and override the default behavior of Vercel from within your project.

This file should be created in your project's root directory and allows you to set:

*   [schema autocomplete](#schema-autocomplete)
*   [buildCommand](#buildcommand)
*   [bunVersion](#bunversion)
*   [cleanUrls](#cleanurls)
*   [crons](#crons)
*   [devCommand](#devcommand)
*   [fluid](#fluid)
*   [framework](#framework)
*   [functions](#functions)
*   [headers](#headers)
*   [ignoreCommand](#ignorecommand)
*   [images](#images)
*   [installCommand](#installcommand)
*   [outputDirectory](#outputdirectory)
*   [public](#public)
*   [redirects](#redirects)
*   [regions](#regions)
*   [functionFailoverRegions](#functionfailoverregions)
*   [rewrites](#rewrites)
*   [trailingSlash](#trailingslash)

## [Schema autocomplete](#schema-autocomplete)

To add autocompletion, type checking, and schema validation to your `vercel.json` file, add the following to the top of your file:

```
{
  "$schema": "https://openapi.vercel.sh/vercel.json"
}
```

## [buildCommand](#buildcommand)

Type: `string | null`

The `buildCommand` property can be used to override the Build Command in the Project Settings dashboard, and the `build` script from the `package.json` file for a given deployment. For more information on the default behavior of the Build Command, visit the [Configure a Build - Build Command](/docs/deployments/configure-a-build#build-command) section.

vercel.json

```
{
  "$schema": "https://openapi.vercel.sh/vercel.json",
  "buildCommand": "next build"
}
```

This value overrides the [Build Command](/docs/deployments/configure-a-build#build-command) in Project Settings.

## [bunVersion](#bunversion)

The Bun runtime is available in [Beta](/docs/release-phases#beta) on [all plans](/docs/plans)

Type: `string`

Value: `"1.x"`

The `bunVersion` property configures your project to use the Bun runtime instead of Node.js. When set, all [Vercel Functions](/docs/functions) and [Routing Middleware](/docs/routing-middleware) not using the [Edge runtime](/docs/functions/runtimes/edge) will run using the specified Bun version.

vercel.json

```
{
  "$schema": "https://openapi.vercel.sh/vercel.json",
  "bunVersion": "1.x"
}
```

When using Next.js with [ISR](/docs/incremental-static-regeneration) (Incremental Static Regeneration), you must also update your `build` and `dev` commands in `package.json`:

package.json

```
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "bun run --bun next dev",
    "build": "bun run --bun next build"
  }
}
```

To learn more about using Bun with Vercel Functions, see the [Bun runtime documentation](/docs/functions/runtimes/bun).

## [cleanUrls](#cleanurls)

Type: `Boolean`.

Default Value: `false`.

When set to `true`, all HTML files and Vercel functions will have their extension removed. When visiting a path that ends with the extension, a 308 response will redirect the client to the extensionless path.

For example, a static file named `about.html` will be served when visiting the `/about` path. Visiting `/about.html` will redirect to `/about`.

Similarly, a Vercel Function named `api/user.go` will be served when visiting `/api/user`. Visiting `/api/user.go` will redirect to `/api/user`.

vercel.json

```
{
  "$schema": "https://openapi.vercel.sh/vercel.json",
  "cleanUrls": true
}
```

If you are using Next.js and running `vercel dev`, you will get a 404 error when visiting a route configured with `cleanUrls` locally. It does however work fine when deployed to Vercel. In the example above, visiting `/about` locally will give you a 404 with `vercel dev` but `/about` will render correctly on Vercel.

## [crons](#crons)

Used to configure [cron jobs](/docs/cron-jobs) for the production deployment of a project.

Type: `Array` of cron `Object`.

Limits:

*   A maximum of string length of 512 for the `path` value.

## [functions](#functions)

Type: `Object` of key `String` and value `Object`.

### [Key definition](#key-definition)

A [glob](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob#glob-primer) pattern that matches the paths of the Vercel functions you would like to customize:

*   `api/*.js` (matches one level e.g. `api/hello.js` but not `api/hello/world.js`)
*   `api/**/*.ts` (matches all levels `api/hello.ts` and `api/hello/world.ts`)
*   `src/pages/**/*` (matches all functions from `src/pages`)
*   `api/test.js`

### [Value definition](#value-definition)

*   `runtime` (optional): The npm package name of a [Runtime](/docs/functions/runtimes), including its version.
*   `memory`: Memory cannot be set in `vercel.json` with [Fluid compute](/docs/fluid-compute) enabled. Instead set it in the Functions tab of your project dashboard. See [setting default function memory](/docs/functions/configuring-functions/memory#setting-your-default-function-memory-/-cpu-size) for more information.
*   `maxDuration` (optional): An integer defining how long your Vercel Function should be allowed to run on every request in seconds (between `1` and the maximum limit of your plan, as mentioned below).
*   `supportsCancellation` (optional): A boolean defining whether your Vercel Function should [support request cancellation](/docs/functions/functions-api-reference#cancel-requests). This is only available when you're using the Node.js runtime.
*   `includeFiles` (optional): A [glob](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob#glob-primer) pattern to match files that should be included in your Vercel Function. If you’re using a Community Runtime, the behavior might vary. Please consult its documentation for more details. (Not supported in Next.js, instead use [`outputFileTracingIncludes`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/output#caveats) in `next.config.js` )
*   `excludeFiles` (optional): A [glob](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob#glob-primer) pattern to match files that should be excluded from your Vercel Function. If you’re using a Community Runtime, the behavior might vary. Please consult its documentation for more details. (Not supported in Next.js, instead use [`outputFileTracingExcludes`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/output#caveats) in `next.config.js` )

### [Description](#description)

By default, no configuration is needed to deploy Vercel functions to Vercel.

For all [officially supported runtimes](/docs/functions/runtimes), the only requirement is to create an `api` directory at the root of your project directory, placing your Vercel functions inside.

The `functions` property cannot be used in combination with `builds`. Since the latter is a legacy configuration property, we recommend dropping it in favor of the new one.

Because [Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)](/docs/incremental-static-regeneration) uses Vercel functions, the same configurations apply. The ISR route can be defined using a glob pattern, and accepts the same properties as when using Vercel functions.

When deployed, each Vercel Function receives the following properties:

*   Memory: 1024 MB (1 GB) - (Optional)
*   Maximum Duration: 10s default - 60s / 1 minute (Hobby), 15s default - 300s / 5 minutes (Pro), or 15s default - 900s / 15 minutes (Enterprise). This [can be configured](/docs/functions/configuring-functions/duration) up to the respective plan limit) - (Optional)

To configure them, you can add the `functions` property.

#### [`functions` property with Vercel functions](#functions-property-with-vercel-functions)

vercel.json

```
{
  "$schema": "https://openapi.vercel.sh/vercel.json",
  "functions": {
    "api/test.js": {
      "memory": 3009,
      "maxDuration": 30
    },
    "api/*.js": {
      "memory": 3009,
      "maxDuration": 30
    }
  }
}
```

#### [`functions` property with ISR](#functions-property-with-isr)

vercel.json

```
{
  "$schema": "https://openapi.vercel.sh/vercel.json",
  "functions": {
    "pages/blog/[hello].tsx": {
      "memory": 1024
    },
    "src/pages/isr/**/*": {
      "maxDuration": 10
    }
  }
}
```

### [Using unsupported runtimes](#using-unsupported-runtimes)

In order to use a runtime that is not [officially supported](/docs/functions/runtimes), you can add a `runtime` property to the definition:

vercel.json

```
{
  "$schema": "https://openapi.vercel.sh/vercel.json",
  "functions": {
    "api/test.php": {
      "runtime": "vercel-php@0.5.2"
    }
  }
}
```

In the example above, the `api/test.php` Vercel Function does not use one of the [officially supported runtimes](/docs/functions/runtimes). In turn, a `runtime` property was added in order to invoke the [vercel-php](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vercel-php) community runtime.

For more information on Runtimes, see the [Runtimes documentation](/docs/functions/runtimes):

## [headers](#headers)

Type: `Array` of header `Object`.

Valid values: a list of header definitions.

vercel.json

```
{
  "$schema": "https://openapi.vercel.sh/vercel.json",
  "headers": [
    {
      "source": "/service-worker.js",
      "headers": [
        {
          "key": "Cache-Control",
          "value": "public, max-age=0, must-revalidate"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "headers": [
        {
          "key": "X-Content-Type-Options",
          "value": "nosniff"
        },
        {
          "key": "X-Frame-Options",
          "value": "DENY"
        },
        {
          "key": "X-XSS-Protection",
          "value": "1; mode=block"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "source": "/:path*",
      "has": [
        {
          "type": "query",
          "key": "authorized"
        }
      ],
      "headers": [
        {
          "key": "x-authorized",
          "value": "true"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

This example configures custom response headers for static files, [Vercel functions](/docs/functions), and a wildcard that matches all routes.

### [Header object definition](#header-object-definition)

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `source` | A pattern that matches each incoming pathname (excluding querystring). |
| `headers` | A non-empty array of key/value pairs representing each response header. |
| `has` | An optional array of `has` objects with the `type`, `key` and `value` properties. Used for conditional path matching based on the presence of specified properties. |
| `missing` | An optional array of `missing` objects with the `type`, `key` and `value` properties. Used for conditional path matching based on the absence of specified properties. |

### [Header `has` or `missing` object definition](#header-has-or-missing-object-definition)

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `type` | `String` | Must be either `header`, `cookie`, `host`, or `query`. The `type` property only applies to request headers sent by clients, not response headers sent by your functions or backends. |
| `key` | `String` | The key from the selected type to match against. For example, if the `type` is `header` and the `key` is `X-Custom-Header`, we will match against the `X-Custom-Header` header key. |
| `value` | `String` or `Object` or `undefined` | The value to check for, if `undefined` any value will match. A regex like string can be used to capture a specific part of the value. For example, if the value `first-(?<paramName>.*)` is used for `first-second` then `second` will be usable in the destination with `:paramName`. If an object is provided, it will match when all conditions are met for its fields below. |

If `value` is an object, it has one or more of the following fields:

| Condition | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `eq` | `String` (optional) | Check for equality |
| `neq` | `String` (optional) | Check for inequality |
| `inc` | `Array<String>` (optional) | Check for inclusion in the array |
| `ninc` | `Array<String>` (optional) | Check for non-inclusion in the array |
| `pre` | `String` (optional) | Check for prefix |
| `suf` | `String` (optional) | Check for suffix |
| `re` | `String` (optional) | Check for a regex match |
| `gt` | `Number` (optional) | Check for greater than |
| `gte` | `Number` (optional) | Check for greater than or equal to |
| `lt` | `Number` (optional) | Check for less than |
| `lte` | `Number` (optional) | Check for less than or equal to |

This example demonstrates using the expressive `value` object to append the header `x-authorized: true` if the `X-Custom-Header` request header's value is prefixed by `valid` and ends with `value`.

vercel.json

```
{
  "$schema": "https://openapi.vercel.sh/vercel.json",
  "headers": [
    {
      "source": "/:path*",
      "has": [
        {
          "type": "header",
          "key": "X-Custom-Header",
          "value": {
            "pre": "valid",
            "suf": "value"
          }
        }
      ],
      "headers": [
        {
          "key": "x-authorized",
          "value": "true"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## [ignoreCommand](#ignorecommand)

This value overrides the [Ignored Build Step](/docs/project-configuration/git-settings#ignored-build-step) in Project Settings.

Type: `string | null`

This `ignoreCommand` property will override the Command for Ignoring the Build Step for a given deployment. When the command exits with code 1, the build will continue. When the command exits with 0, the build is ignored. For more information on the default behavior of the Ignore Command, visit the [Ignored Build Step](/docs/project-configuration/git-settings#ignored-build-step) section.

vercel.json

```
{
  "$schema": "https://openapi.vercel.sh/vercel.json",
  "ignoreCommand": "git diff --quiet HEAD^ HEAD ./"
}
```

## [installCommand](#installcommand)

This value overrides the [Install Command](/docs/deployments/configure-a-build#install-command) in Project Settings.

Type: `string | null`

The `installCommand` property can be used to override the Install Command in the Project Settings dashboard for a given deployment. This setting is useful for trying out a new package manager for the project. An empty string value will cause the Install Command to be skipped. For more information on the default behavior of the install command visit the [Configure a Build - Install Command](/docs/deployments/configure-a-build#install-command) section.

vercel.json

```
{
  "$schema": "https://openapi.vercel.sh/vercel.json",
  "installCommand": "npm install"
}
```

## [images](#images)

The `images` property defines the behavior of [Vercel's native Image Optimization API](/docs/image-optimization), which allows on-demand optimization of images at runtime.

Type: `Object`

### [Value definition](#value-definition)

*   `sizes` - Required - Array of allowed image widths. The Image Optimization API will return an error if the `w` parameter is not defined in this list.
*   `localPatterns` - Allow-list of local image paths which can be used with the Image Optimization API.
*   `remotePatterns` - Allow-list of external domains which can be used with the Image Optimization API.
*   `minimumCacheTTL` - Cache duration (in seconds) for the optimized images.
*   `qualities` - Array of allowed image qualities. The Image Optimization API will return an error if the `q` parameter is not defined in this list.
*   `formats` - Supported output image formats. Allowed values are either `"image/avif"` and/or `"image/webp"`.
*   `dangerouslyAllowSVG` - Allow SVG input image URLs. This is disabled by default for security purposes.
*   `contentSecurityPolicy` - Specifies the [Content Security Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) of the optimized images.
*   `contentDispositionType` - Specifies the value of the `"Content-Disposition"` response header. Allowed values are `"inline"` or `"attachment"`.

vercel.json

```
{
  "$schema": "https://openapi.vercel.sh/vercel.json",
  "images": {
    "sizes": [256, 640, 1080, 2048, 3840],
    "localPatterns": [{
      "pathname": "^/assets/.*$",
      "search": ""
    }]
    "remotePatterns": [
      {
        "protocol": "https",

    "dangerouslyAllowSVG": false,
    "contentSecurityPolicy": "script-src 'none'; frame-src 'none'; sandbox;",
    "contentDispositionType": "inline"
  }
}
```

## [outputDirectory](#outputdirectory)

This value overrides the [Output Directory](/docs/deployments/configure-a-build#output-directory) in Project Settings.

Type: `string | null`

The `outputDirectory` property can be used to override the Output Directory in the Project Settings dashboard for a given deployment.

In the following example, the deployment will look for the `build` directory rather than the default `public` or `.` root directory. For more information on the default behavior of the Output Directory see the [Configure a Build - Output Directory](/docs/deployments/configure-a-build#output-directory) section. The following example is a `vercel.json` file that overrides the `outputDirectory` to `build`:

vercel.json

```
{
  "$schema": "https://openapi.vercel.sh/vercel.json",
  "outputDirectory": "build"
}
```

## [public](#public)

Type: `Boolean`.

Default Value: `false`.

When set to `true`, both the [source view](/docs/deployments/build-features#source-view) and [logs view](/docs/deployments/build-features#logs-view) will be publicly accessible.

vercel.json

```
{
  "$schema": "https://openapi.vercel.sh/vercel.json",
  "public": true
}
```

## [redirects](#redirects)

Type: `Array` of redirect `Object`.

Valid values: a list of redirect definitions.

### [Redirects examples](#redirects-examples)

Some redirects and rewrites configurations can accidentally become gateways for semantic attacks. Learn how to check and protect your configurations with the [Enhancing Security for Redirects and Rewrites guide](/guides/enhancing-security-for-redirects-and-rewrites).

This example redirects requests to the path `/me` from your site's root to the `profile.html` file relative to your site's root with a [307 Temporary Redirect](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/307):

vercel.json

```
{
  "$schema": "https://openapi.vercel.sh/vercel.json",
  "redirects": [
    { "source": "/me", "destination": "/profile.html", "permanent": false }
  ]
}
```

This example redirects requests to the path `/me` from your site's root to the `profile.html` file relative to your site's root with a [308 Permanent Redirect](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/308):

vercel.json

```
{
  "$schema": "https://openapi.vercel.sh/vercel.json",
  "redirects": [
    { "source": "/me", "destination": "/profile.html", "permanent": true }
  ]
}
```

This example redirects requests to the path `/user` from your site's root to the api route `/api/user` relative to your site's root with a [301 Moved Permanently](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/301):

vercel.json

```
{
  "$schema": "https://openapi.vercel.sh/vercel.json",
  "redirects": [
    { "source": "/user", "destination": "/api/user", "statusCode": 301 }
  ]
}
```

This example redirects requests to the path `/view-source` from your site's root to the absolute path `https://github.com/vercel/vercel` of an external site with a redirect status of 308:

vercel.json

```
{
  "$schema": "https://openapi.vercel.sh/vercel.json",
  "redirects": [
    {
      "source": "/view-source",
      "destination": "https://github.com/vercel/vercel"
    }
  ]
}
```

This example redirects requests to all the paths (including all sub-directories and pages) from your site's root to the absolute path `https://vercel.com/docs` of an external site with a redirect status of 308:

vercel.json

```
{
  "$schema": "https://openapi.vercel.sh/vercel.json",
  "redirects": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "https://vercel.com/docs"
    }
  ]
}
```

This example uses wildcard path matching to redirect requests to any path (including subdirectories) under `/blog/` from your site's root to a corresponding path under `/news/` relative to your site's root with a redirect status of 308:

vercel.json

```
{
  "$schema": "https://openapi.vercel.sh/vercel.json",
  "redirects": [
    {
      "source": "/blog/:path*",
      "destination": "/news/:path*"
    }
  ]
}
```

This example uses regex path matching to redirect requests to any path under `/posts/` that only contain numerical digits from your site's root to a corresponding path under `/news/` relative to your site's root with a redirect status of 308:

vercel.json

```
{
  "$schema": "https://openapi.vercel.sh/vercel.json",
  "redirects": [
    {
      "source": "/post/:path(\\d{1,})",
      "destination": "/news/:path*"
    }
  ]
}
```

This example redirects requests to any path from your site's root that does not start with `/uk/` and has `x-vercel-ip-country` header value of `GB` to a corresponding path under `/uk/` relative to your site's root with a redirect status of 307:

vercel.json

```
{
  "$schema": "https://openapi.vercel.sh/vercel.json",
  "redirects": [
    {
      "source": "/:path((?!uk/).*)",
      "has": [
        {
          "type": "header",
          "key": "x-vercel-ip-country",
          "value": "GB"
        }
      ],
      "destination": "/uk/:path*",
      "permanent": false
    }
  ]
}
```

Using `has` does not yet work locally while using `vercel dev`, but does work when deployed.

### [Redirect object definition](#redirect-object-definition)

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `source` | A pattern that matches each incoming pathname (excluding querystring). |
| `destination` | A location destination defined as an absolute pathname or external URL. |
| `permanent` | An optional boolean to toggle between permanent and temporary redirect (default `true`). When `true`, the status code is [308](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/308). When `false` the status code is [307](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/307). |
| `statusCode` | An optional integer to define the status code of the redirect. Used when you need a value other than 307/308 from `permanent`, and therefore cannot be used with `permanent` boolean. |
| `has` | An optional array of `has` objects with the `type`, `key` and `value` properties. Used for conditional redirects based on the presence of specified properties. |
| `missing` | An optional array of `missing` objects with the `type`, `key` and `value` properties. Used for conditional redirects based on the absence of specified properties. |

### [Redirect `has` or `missing` object definition](#redirect-has-or-missing-object-definition)

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `type` | `String` | Must be either `header`, `cookie`, `host`, or `query`. The `type` property only applies to request headers sent by clients, not response headers sent by your functions or backends. |
| `key` | `String` | The key from the selected type to match against. For example, if the `type` is `header` and the `key` is `X-Custom-Header`, we will match against the `X-Custom-Header` header key. |
| `value` | `String` or `Object` or `undefined` | The value to check for, if `undefined` any value will match. A regex like string can be used to capture a specific part of the value. For example, if the value `first-(?<paramName>.*)` is used for `first-second` then `second` will be usable in the destination with `:paramName`. If an object is provided, it will match when all conditions are met for its fields below. |

If `value` is an object, it has one or more of the following fields:

| Condition | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `eq` | `String` (optional) | Check for equality |
| `neq` | `String` (optional) | Check for inequality |
| `inc` | `Array<String>` (optional) | Check for inclusion in the array |
| `ninc` | `Array<String>` (optional) | Check for non-inclusion in the array |
| `pre` | `String` (optional) | Check for prefix |
| `suf` | `String` (optional) | Check for suffix |
| `re` | `String` (optional) | Check for a regex match |
| `gt` | `Number` (optional) | Check for greater than |
| `gte` | `Number` (optional) | Check for greater than or equal to |
| `lt` | `Number` (optional) | Check for less than |
| `lte` | `Number` (optional) | Check for less than or equal to |

This example uses the expressive `value` object to define a route that redirects users with a redirect status of 308 to `/end` only if the `X-Custom-Header` header's value is prefixed by `valid` and ends with `value`.

vercel.json

```
{
  "$schema": "https://openapi.vercel.sh/vercel.json",
  "redirects": [
    {
      "source": "/start",
      "destination": "/end",
      "has": [
        {
          "type": "header",
          "key": "X-Custom-Header",
          "value": {
            "pre": "valid",
            "suf": "value"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## [regions](#regions)

This value overrides the [Vercel Function Region](/docs/functions/regions) in Project Settings.

Type: `Array` of region identifier `String`.

Valid values: List of [regions](/docs/regions), defaults to `iad1`.

You can define the regions where your [Vercel functions](/docs/functions) are executed. Users on Pro and Enterprise can deploy to multiple regions. Hobby plans can select any single region. To learn more, see [Configuring Regions](/docs/functions/configuring-functions/region#project-configuration).

Function responses [can be cached](/docs/edge-cache) in the requested regions. Selecting a Vercel Function region does not impact static files, which are deployed to every region by default.

vercel.json

```
{
  "$schema": "https://openapi.vercel.sh/vercel.json",
  "regions": ["sfo1"]
}
```

## [functionFailoverRegions](#functionfailoverregions)

Setting failover regions for Vercel functions are available on [Enterprise plans](/docs/plans/enterprise)

Set this property to specify the [region](/docs/functions/regions) to which a Vercel Function should fallback when the default region(s) are unavailable.

Type: `Array` of region identifier `String`.

Valid values: List of [regions](/docs/regions).

vercel.json

```
{
  "$schema": "https://openapi.vercel.sh/vercel.json",
  "functionFailoverRegions": ["iad1", "sfo1"]
}
```

These regions serve as a fallback to any regions specified in the [`regions` configuration](/docs/project-configuration#regions). The region Vercel selects to invoke your function depends on availability and ingress. For instance:

*   Vercel always attempts to invoke the function in the primary region. If you specify more than one primary region in the `regions` property, Vercel selects the region geographically closest to the request
*   If all primary regions are unavailable, Vercel automatically fails over to the regions specified in `functionFailoverRegions`, selecting the region geographically closest to the request
*   The order of the regions in `functionFailoverRegions` does not matter as Vercel automatically selects the region geographically closest to the request

To learn more about automatic failover for Vercel Functions, see [Automatic failover](/docs/functions/configuring-functions/region#automatic-failover). Vercel Functions using the Edge runtime will [automatically failover](/docs/functions/configuring-functions/region#automatic-failover) with no configuration required.

Region failover is supported with Secure Compute, see [Region Failover](/docs/secure-compute#region-failover) to learn more.

## [rewrites](#rewrites)

Type: `Array` of rewrite `Object`.

Valid values: a list of rewrite definitions.

If [`cleanUrls`](/docs/project-configuration#cleanurls) is set to `true` in your project's `vercel.json`, do not include the file extension in the source or destination path. For example, `/about-our-company.html` would be `/about-our-company`

Some redirects and rewrites configurations can accidentally become gateways for semantic attacks. Learn how to check and protect your configurations with the [Enhancing Security for Redirects and Rewrites guide](/guides/enhancing-security-for-redirects-and-rewrites).

### [Rewrites examples](#rewrites-examples)

*   This example rewrites requests to the path `/about` from your site's root to the `/about-our-company.html` file relative to your site's root:
    
    vercel.json
    
    ```
    {
      "$schema": "https://openapi.vercel.sh/vercel.json",
      "rewrites": [
        { "source": "/about", "destination": "/about-our-company.html" }
      ]
    }
    ```
    
*   This example rewrites all requests to the root path which is often used for a Single Page Application (SPA).
    
    vercel.json
    
    ```
    {
      "$schema": "https://openapi.vercel.sh/vercel.json",
      "rewrites": [{ "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/index.html" }]
    }
    ```
    
*   This example rewrites requests to the paths under `/resize` that with 2 paths levels (defined as variables `width` and `height` that can be used in the destination value) to the api route `/api/sharp` relative to your site's root:
    
    vercel.json
    
    ```
    {
      "$schema": "https://openapi.vercel.sh/vercel.json",
      "rewrites": [
        { "source": "/resize/:width/:height", "destination": "/api/sharp" }
      ]
    }
    ```
    
*   This example uses wildcard path matching to rewrite requests to any path (including subdirectories) under `/proxy/` from your site's root to a corresponding path under the root of an external site `https://example.com/`:
    
    vercel.json
    
    ```
    {
      "$schema": "https://openapi.vercel.sh/vercel.json",
      "rewrites": [
        {
          "source": "/proxy/:match*",
          "destination": "https://example.com/:match*"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```
    
*   This example rewrites requests to any path from your site's root that does not start with /uk/ and has x-vercel-ip-country header value of GB to a corresponding path under /uk/ relative to your site's root:
    
    vercel.json
    
    ```
    {
      "$schema": "https://openapi.vercel.sh/vercel.json",
      "rewrites": [
        {
          "source": "/:path((?!uk/).*)",
          "has": [
            {
              "type": "header",
              "key": "x-vercel-ip-country",
              "value": "GB"
            }
          ],
          "destination": "/uk/:path*"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```
    
*   This example rewrites requests to the path `/dashboard` from your site's root that does not have a cookie with key `auth_token` to the path `/login` relative to your site's root:
    
    vercel.json
    
    ```
    {
      "$schema": "https://openapi.vercel.sh/vercel.json",
      "rewrites": [
        {
          "source": "/dashboard",
          "missing": [
            {
              "type": "cookie",
              "key": "auth_token"
            }
          ],
          "destination": "/login"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```
    

### [Rewrite object definition](#rewrite-object-definition)

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `source` | A pattern that matches each incoming pathname (excluding querystring). |
| `destination` | A location destination defined as an absolute pathname or external URL. |
| `permanent` | A boolean to toggle between permanent and temporary redirect (default true). When `true`, the status code is [308](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/308). When `false` the status code is [307](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/307). |
| `has` | An optional array of `has` objects with the `type`, `key` and `value` properties. Used for conditional rewrites based on the presence of specified properties. |
| `missing` | An optional array of `missing` objects with the `type`, `key` and `value` properties. Used for conditional rewrites based on the absence of specified properties. |

### [Rewrite `has` or `missing` object definition](#rewrite-has-or-missing-object-definition)

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `type` | `String` | Must be either `header`, `cookie`, `host`, or `query`. The `type` property only applies to request headers sent by clients, not response headers sent by your functions or backends. |
| `key` | `String` | The key from the selected type to match against. For example, if the `type` is `header` and the `key` is `X-Custom-Header`, we will match against the `X-Custom-Header` header key. |
| `value` | `String` or `Object` or `undefined` | The value to check for, if `undefined` any value will match. A regex like string can be used to capture a specific part of the value. For example, if the value `first-(?<paramName>.*)` is used for `first-second` then `second` will be usable in the destination with `:paramName`. If an object is provided, it will match when all conditions are met for its fields below. |

If `value` is an object, it has one or more of the following fields:

| Condition | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `eq` | `String` (optional) | Check for equality |
| `neq` | `String` (optional) | Check for inequality |
| `inc` | `Array<String>` (optional) | Check for inclusion in the array |
| `ninc` | `Array<String>` (optional) | Check for non-inclusion in the array |
| `pre` | `String` (optional) | Check for prefix |
| `suf` | `String` (optional) | Check for suffix |
| `re` | `String` (optional) | Check for a regex match |
| `gt` | `Number` (optional) | Check for greater than |
| `gte` | `Number` (optional) | Check for greater than or equal to |
| `lt` | `Number` (optional) | Check for less than |
| `lte` | `Number` (optional) | Check for less than or equal to |

This example demonstrates using the expressive `value` object to define a route that rewrites users to `/end` only if the `X-Custom-Header` header's value is prefixed by `valid` and ends with `value`.

vercel.json

```
{
  "$schema": "https://openapi.vercel.sh/vercel.json",
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/start",
      "destination": "/end",
      "has": [
        {
          "type": "header",
          "key": "X-Custom-Header",
          "value": {
            "pre": "valid",
            "suf": "value"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

The `source` property should NOT be a file because precedence is given to the filesystem prior to rewrites being applied. Instead, you should rename your static file or Vercel Function.

Using `has` does not yet work locally while using `vercel dev`, but does work when deployed.

Learn more about [rewrites](/docs/rewrites) on Vercel.

## [trailingSlash](#trailingslash)

Type: `Boolean`.

Default Value: `undefined`.

### [false](#false)

When `trailingSlash: false`, visiting a path that ends with a forward slash will respond with a 308 status code and redirect to the path without the trailing slash.

For example, the `/about/` path will redirect to `/about`.

vercel.json

```
{
  "$schema": "https://openapi.vercel.sh/vercel.json",
  "trailingSlash": false
}
```

### [true](#true)

When `trailingSlash: true`, visiting a path that does not end with a forward slash will respond with a 308 status code and redirect to the path with a trailing slash.

For example, the `/about` path will redirect to `/about/`.

However, paths with a file extension will not redirect to a trailing slash.

For example, the `/about/styles.css` path will not redirect, but the `/about/styles` path will redirect to `/about/styles/`.

vercel.json

```
{
  "$schema": "https://openapi.vercel.sh/vercel.json",
  "trailingSlash": true
}
```

### [undefined](#undefined)

When `trailingSlash: undefined`, visiting a path with or without a trailing slash will not redirect.

For example, both `/about` and `/about/` will serve the same content without redirecting.

This is not recommended because it could lead to search engines indexing two different pages with duplicate content.

## [Legacy](#legacy)

Legacy properties are still supported for backwards compatibility, but are deprecated.

### [name](#name)

The `name` property has been deprecated in favor of [Project Linking](/docs/cli/project-linking), which allows you to link a Vercel project to your local codebase when you run `vercel`.

Type: `String`.

Valid values: string name for the deployment.

Limits:

*   A maximum length of 52 characters
*   Only lower case alphanumeric characters or hyphens are allowed
*   Cannot begin or end with a hyphen, or contain multiple consecutive hyphens

The prefix for all new deployment instances. Vercel CLI usually generates this field automatically based on the name of the directory. But if you'd like to define it explicitly, this is the way to go.

The defined name is also used to organize the deployment into [a project](/docs/projects/overview).

vercel.json

```
{
  "$schema": "https://openapi.vercel.sh/vercel.json",
  "name": "example-app"
}
```

### [version](#version)

The `version` property should not be used anymore.

Type: `Number`.

Valid values: `1`, `2`.

Specifies the Vercel Platform version the deployment should use.

vercel.json

```
{
  "$schema": "https://openapi.vercel.sh/vercel.json",
  "version": 2
}
```

### [alias](#alias)

The `alias` property should not be used anymore. To assign a custom Domain to your project, please [define it in the Project Settings](/docs/domains/add-a-domain) instead. Once your domains are, they will take precedence over the configuration property.

Type: `Array` or `String`.

Valid values: [domain names](/docs/domains/add-a-domain) (optionally including subdomains) added to the account, or a string for a suffixed URL using `.vercel.app` or a Custom Deployment Suffix ([available on the Enterprise plan](/pricing)).

Limit: A maximum of 64 aliases in the array.

The alias or aliases are applied automatically using [Vercel for GitHub](/docs/git/vercel-for-github), [Vercel for GitLab](/docs/git/vercel-for-gitlab), or [Vercel for Bitbucket](/docs/git/vercel-for-bitbucket) when merging or pushing to the [Production Branch](/docs/git#production-branch).

You can deploy to the defined aliases using [Vercel CLI](/docs/cli) by setting the [production deployment environment target](/docs/domains/deploying-and-redirecting).

vercel.json

```
{
  "$schema": "https://openapi.vercel.sh/vercel.json",
  "alias": ["my-domain.com", "my-alias"]
}
```

### [scope](#scope)

The `scope` property has been deprecated in favor of [Project Linking](/docs/cli/project-linking), which allows you to link a Vercel project to your local codebase when you run `vercel`.

Type: `String`.

Valid values: For teams, either an ID or slug. For users, either a email address, username, or ID.

This property determines the scope ([Hobby team](/docs/accounts/create-an-account#creating-a-hobby-account) or [team](/docs/accounts/create-a-team)) under which the project will be deployed by [Vercel CLI](/cli).

It also affects any other actions that the user takes within the directory that contains this configuration (e.g. listing [environment variables](/docs/environment-variables) using `vercel secrets ls`).

vercel.json

```
{
  "$schema": "https://openapi.vercel.sh/vercel.json",
  "scope": "my-team"
}
```

Deployments made through [Git](/docs/git) will ignore the `scope` property because the repository is already connected to [project](/docs/projects/overview).

### [env](#env)

We recommend against using this property. To add custom environment variables to your project [define them in the Project Settings](/docs/environment-variables).

Type: `Object` of `String` keys and values.

Valid values: environment keys and values.

Environment variables passed to the invoked [Vercel functions](/docs/functions).

This example will pass the `MY_KEY` static env to all [Vercel functions](/docs/functions) and the `SECRET` resolved from the `my-secret-name` [secret](/docs/environment-variables/reserved-environment-variables) dynamically.

vercel.json

```
{
  "$schema": "https://openapi.vercel.sh/vercel.json",
  "env": {
    "MY_KEY": "this is the value",
    "SECRET": "@my-secret-name"
  }
}
```

### [build.env](#build.env)

We recommend against using this property. To add custom environment variables to your project [define them in the Project Settings](/docs/environment-variables).

Type: `Object` of `String` keys and values inside the `build` `Object`.

Valid values: environment keys and values.

[Environment variables](/docs/environment-variables) passed to the [Build](/docs/deployments/configure-a-build) processes.

The following example will pass the `MY_KEY` environment variable to all [Builds](/docs/deployments/configure-a-build) and the `SECRET` resolved from the `my-secret-name` [secret](/docs/environment-variables/reserved-environment-variables) dynamically.

vercel.json

```
{
  "$schema": "https://openapi.vercel.sh/vercel.json",
  "env": {
    "MY_KEY": "this is the value",
    "SECRET": "@my-secret-name"
  }
}
```

### [builds](#builds)

We recommend against using this property. To customize Vercel functions, please use the [functions](#functions) property instead. If you'd like to deploy a monorepo, see the [Monorepo docs](/docs/monorepos).

Type: `Array` of build `Object`.

Valid values: a list of build descriptions whose `src` references valid source files.

#### [Build object definition](#build-object-definition)

*   `src` (`String`): A glob expression or pathname. If more than one file is resolved, one build will be created per matched file. It can include `*` and `**`.
*   `use` (`String`): An npm module to be installed by the build process. It can include a semver compatible version (e.g.: `@org/proj@1`).
*   `config` (`Object`): Optionally, an object including arbitrary metadata to be passed to the Builder.

The following will include all HTML files as-is (to be served statically), and build all Python files and JS files into [Vercel functions](/docs/functions):

vercel.json

```
{
  "$schema": "https://openapi.vercel.sh/vercel.json",
  "builds": [
    { "src": "*.html", "use": "@vercel/static" },
    { "src": "*.py", "use": "@vercel/python" },
    { "src": "*.js", "use": "@vercel/node" }
  ]
}
```

When at least one `builds` item is specified, only the outputs of the build processes will be included in the resulting deployment as a security precaution. This is why we need to allowlist static files explicitly with `@vercel/static`.

### [routes](#routes)

We recommend using [cleanUrls](#cleanurls), [trailingSlash](#trailingslash), [redirects](#redirects), [rewrites](#rewrites), and/or [headers](#headers) instead.

The `routes` property is only meant to be used for advanced integration purposes, such as the [Build Output API](/docs/build-output-api/v3), and cannot be used in conjunction with any of the properties mentioned above.

See the [upgrading routes section](#upgrading-legacy-routes) to learn how to migrate away from this property.

Type: `Array` of route `Object`.

Valid values: a list of route definitions.

#### [Route object definition](#route-object-definition)

*   `src`: A [PCRE-compatible regular expression](https://www.pcre.org/original/doc/html/pcrepattern.html) that matches each incoming pathname (excluding querystring).
*   `methods`: A set of HTTP method types. If no method is provided, requests with any HTTP method will be a candidate for the route.
*   `dest`: A destination pathname or full URL, including querystring, with the ability to embed capture groups as $1, $2…
*   `headers`: A set of headers to apply for responses.
*   `status`: A status code to respond with. Can be used in tandem with `Location:` header to implement redirects.
*   `continue`: A boolean to change matching behavior. If `true`, routing will continue even when the `src` is matched.
*   `has`: An optional array of `has` objects with the `type`, `key` and `value` properties. Used for conditional path matching based on the presence of specified properties
*   `missing`: An optional array of `missing` objects with the `type`, `key` and `value` properties. Used for conditional path matching based on the absence of specified properties
*   `mitigate`: An optional object with the property `action`, which can either be "challenge" or "deny". These perform [mitigation actions](/docs/vercel-firewall/vercel-waf/custom-rules#custom-rule-configuration) on requests that match the route.
*   `transforms`: An optional array of `transform` objects to apply. Transform rules let you append, set, or remove request/response headers and query parameters at the edge so you can enforce security headers, inject analytics tags, or personalize content without touching your application code. See examples [below](#transform-examples).

Routes are processed in the order they are defined in the array, so wildcard/catch-all patterns should usually be last.

#### [Route has and missing object definition](#route-has-and-missing-object-definition)

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `type` | `String` | Must be either `header`, `cookie`, `host`, or `query`. The `type` property only applies to request headers sent by clients, not response headers sent by your functions or backends. |
| `key` | `String` | The key from the selected type to match against. For example, if the `type` is `header` and the `key` is `X-Custom-Header`, we will match against the `X-Custom-Header` header key. |
| `value` | `String` or `Object` or `undefined` | The value to check for, if `undefined` any value will match. A regex like string can be used to capture a specific part of the value. For example, if the value `first-(?<paramName>.*)` is used for `first-second` then `second` will be usable in the destination with `:paramName`. If an object is provided, it will match when all conditions are met for its fields below. |

If `value` is an object, it has one or more of the following fields:

| Condition | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `eq` | `String` (optional) | Check for equality |
| `neq` | `String` (optional) | Check for inequality |
| `inc` | `Array<String>` (optional) | Check for inclusion in the array |
| `ninc` | `Array<String>` (optional) | Check for non-inclusion in the array |
| `pre` | `String` (optional) | Check for prefix |
| `suf` | `String` (optional) | Check for suffix |
| `re` | `String` (optional) | Check for a regex match |
| `gt` | `Number` (optional) | Check for greater than |
| `gte` | `Number` (optional) | Check for greater than or equal to |
| `lt` | `Number` (optional) | Check for less than |
| `lte` | `Number` (optional) | Check for less than or equal to |

This example uses the expressive `value` object to define a route that will only rewrite users to `/end` if the `X-Custom-Header` header's value is prefixed by `valid` and ends with `value`:

vercel.json

```
{
  "$schema": "https://openapi.vercel.sh/vercel.json",
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/start",
      "dest": "/end",
      "has": [
        {
          "type": "header",
          "key": "X-Custom-Header",
          "value": {
            "pre": "valid",
            "suf": "value"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

This example configures custom routes that map to static files and [Vercel functions](/docs/functions):

vercel.json

```
{
  "$schema": "https://openapi.vercel.sh/vercel.json",
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/redirect",
      "status": 308,
      "headers": { "Location": "https://example.com/" }
    },
    {
      "src": "/custom-page",
      "headers": { "cache-control": "s-maxage=1000" },
      "dest": "/index.html"
    },
    { "src": "/api", "dest": "/my-api.js" },
    { "src": "/users", "methods": ["POST"], "dest": "/users-api.js" },
    { "src": "/users/(?<id>[^/]*)", "dest": "/users-api.js?id=$id" },
    { "src": "/legacy", "status": 404 },
    { "src": "/.*", "dest": "https://my-old-site.com" }
  ]
}
```

### [Transform object definition](#transform-object-definition)

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `type` | `String` | Must be either `request.query`, `request.headers`, or `response.headers`. This specifies the scope of what your transforms will apply to. |
| `op` | `String` | These specify the possible operations:  
\- `append` appends `args` to the value of the key, and will set if missing  
\- `set` sets the key and value if missing  
\- `delete` deletes the key entirely if `args` is not provided; otherwise, it will delete the value of `args` from the matching key |
| `target` | `Object` | An object with key `key`, which is either a `String` or an `Object`. If it is a string, it will be used as the key for the target. If it is an object, it may contain one or more of the properties [seen below.](#transform-target-object-definition) |
| `args` | `String` or `String[]` or `undefined` | If `args` is a string or string array, it will be used as the value for the target according to the `op` property. |

#### [Transform target object definition](#transform-target-object-definition)

Target is an object with a `key` property. For the `set` operation, the `key` property is used as the header or query key. For other operations, it is used as a matching condition to determine if the transform should be applied.

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `key` | `String` or `Object` | It may be a string or an object. If it is an object, it must have one or more of the properties defined in the [Transform key object definition](#transform-key-object-definition) below. |

#### [Transform key object definition](#transform-key-object-definition)

When the `key` property is an object, it can contain one or more of the following conditional matching properties:

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `eq` | `String` or `Number` | Check equality on a value |
| `neq` | `String` | Check inequality on a value |
| `inc` | `String[]` | Check inclusion in an array of values |
| `ninc` | `String[]` | Check non-inclusion in an array of values |
| `pre` | `String` | Check if value starts with a prefix |
| `suf` | `String` | Check if value ends with a suffix |
| `gt` | `Number` | Check if value is greater than |
| `gte` | `Number` | Check if value is greater than or equal to |
| `lt` | `Number` | Check if value is less than |
| `lte` | `Number` | Check if value is less than or equal to |

#### [Transform examples](#transform-examples)

These examples demonstrate practical use-cases for route transforms.

In this example, you remove the incoming request header `x-custom-header` from all requests and responses to the `/home` route:

vercel.json

```
{
  "$schema": "https://openapi.vercel.sh/vercel.json",
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/home",
      "transforms": [
        {
          "type": "request.headers",
          "op": "delete",
          "target": {
            "key": "x-custom-header"
          }
        },
        {
          "type": "response.headers",
          "op": "delete",
          "target": {
            "key": "x-custom-header"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

In this example, you override the incoming query parameter `theme` to `dark` for all requests to the `/home` route, and set if it doesn't already exist:

vercel.json

```
{
  "$schema": "https://openapi.vercel.sh/vercel.json",
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/home",
      "transforms": [
        {
          "type": "request.query",
          "op": "set",
          "target": {
            "key": "theme"
          },
          "args": "dark"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

In this example, you append multiple values to the incoming request header `x-content-type-options` for all requests to the `/home` route:

vercel.json

```
{
  "$schema": "https://openapi.vercel.sh/vercel.json",
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/home",
      "transforms": [
        {
          "type": "request.headers",
          "op": "append",
          "target": {
            "key": "x-content-type-options"
          },
          "args": ["nosniff", "no-sniff"]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

In this example, you delete any header that begins with `x-react-router-` for all requests to the `/home` route:

vercel.json

```
{
  "$schema": "https://openapi.vercel.sh/vercel.json",
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/home",
      "transforms": [
        {
          "type": "request.headers",
          "op": "delete",
          "target": {
            "key": {
              "pre": "x-react-router-"
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

You can integrate transforms with existing matching capabilities through the [`has` and `missing` properties for routes](/docs/project-configuration#routes), along with using expressive matching conditions through the [Transform key object definition](#transform-key-object-definition).

### [Upgrading legacy routes](#upgrading-legacy-routes)

In most cases, you can upgrade legacy `routes` usage to the newer [`rewrites`](/docs/project-configuration#rewrites), [`redirects`](/docs/project-configuration#redirects), [`headers`](/docs/project-configuration#headers), [`cleanUrls`](/docs/project-configuration#cleanurls) or [`trailingSlash`](/docs/project-configuration#trailingslash) properties.

Here are some examples that show how to upgrade legacy `routes` to the equivalent new property.

#### [Route Parameters](#route-parameters)

With `routes`, you use a [PCRE Regex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl_Compatible_Regular_Expressions) named group to match the ID and then pass that parameter in the query string. The following example matches a URL like `/product/532004` and proxies to `/api/product?id=532004`:

vercel.json

```
{
  "$schema": "https://openapi.vercel.sh/vercel.json",
  "routes": [{ "src": "/product/(?<id>[^/]+)", "dest": "/api/product?id=$id" }]
}
```

With [`rewrites`](/docs/project-configuration#rewrites), named parameters are automatically passed in the query string. The following example is equivalent to the legacy `routes` usage above, but uses `rewrites` instead:

vercel.json

```
{
  "$schema": "https://openapi.vercel.sh/vercel.json",
  "rewrites": [{ "source": "/product/:id", "destination": "/api/product" }]
}
```

#### [Legacy redirects](#legacy-redirects)

With `routes`, you specify the status code to use a 307 Temporary Redirect. Also, this redirect needs to be defined before other routes. The following example redirects all paths in the `posts` directory to the `blog` directory, but keeps the path in the new location:

vercel.json

```
{
  "$schema": "https://openapi.vercel.sh/vercel.json",
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/posts/(.*)",
      "headers": { "Location": "/blog/$1" },
      "status": 307
    }
  ]
}
```

With [`redirects`](/docs/project-configuration#redirects), you disable the `permanent` property to use a 307 Temporary Redirect. Also, `redirects` are always processed before `rewrites`. The following example is equivalent to the legacy `routes` usage above, but uses `redirects` instead:

vercel.json

```
{
  "$schema": "https://openapi.vercel.sh/vercel.json",
  "redirects": [
    {
      "source": "/posts/:id",
      "destination": "/blog/:id",
      "permanent": false
    }
  ]
}
```

#### [Legacy SPA Fallback](#legacy-spa-fallback)

With `routes`, you use `"handle": "filesystem"` to give precedence to the filesystem and exit early if the requested path matched a file. The following example will serve the `index.html` file for all paths that do not match a file in the filesystem:

vercel.json

```
{
  "$schema": "https://openapi.vercel.sh/vercel.json",
  "routes": [
    { "handle": "filesystem" },
    { "src": "/(.*)", "dest": "/index.html" }
  ]
}
```

With [`rewrites`](/docs/project-configuration#rewrites), the filesystem check is the default behavior. If you want to change the name of files at the filesystem level, file renames can be performed during the [Build Step](/docs/deployments/configure-a-build), but not with `rewrites`. The following example is equivalent to the legacy `routes` usage above, but uses `rewrites` instead:

vercel.json

```
{
  "$schema": "https://openapi.vercel.sh/vercel.json",
  "rewrites": [{ "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/index.html" }]
}
```

#### [Legacy Headers](#legacy-headers)

With `routes`, you use `"continue": true` to prevent stopping at the first match. The following example adds `Cache-Control` headers to the favicon and other static assets:

vercel.json

```
{
  "$schema": "https://openapi.vercel.sh/vercel.json",
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/favicon.ico",
      "headers": { "Cache-Control": "public, max-age=3600" },
      "continue": true
    },
    {
      "src": "/assets/(.*)",
      "headers": { "Cache-Control": "public, max-age=31556952, immutable" },
      "continue": true
    }
  ]
}
```

With [`headers`](/docs/project-configuration#headers), this is no longer necessary since that is the default behavior. The following example is equivalent to the legacy `routes` usage above, but uses `headers` instead:

vercel.json

```
{
  "$schema": "https://openapi.vercel.sh/vercel.json",
  "headers": [
    {
      "source": "/favicon.ico",
      "headers": [
        {
          "key": "Cache-Control",
          "value": "public, max-age=3600"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "source": "/assets/(.*)",
      "headers": [
        {
          "key": "Cache-Control",
          "value": "public, max-age=31556952, immutable"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### [Legacy Pattern Matching](#legacy-pattern-matching)

With `routes`, you need to escape a dot with two backslashes, otherwise it would match any character [PCRE Regex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl_Compatible_Regular_Expressions). The following example matches the literal `atom.xml` and proxies to `/api/rss` to dynamically generate RSS:

vercel.json

```
{
  "$schema": "https://openapi.vercel.sh/vercel.json",
  "routes": [{ "src": "/atom\\.xml", "dest": "/api/rss" }]
}
```

With [`rewrites`](/docs/project-configuration#rewrites), the `.` is not a special character so it does not need to be escaped. The following example is equivalent to the legacy `routes` usage above, but instead uses `rewrites`:

vercel.json

```
{
  "$schema": "https://openapi.vercel.sh/vercel.json",
  "rewrites": [{ "source": "/atom.xml", "destination": "/api/rss" }]
}
```

#### [Legacy Negative Lookahead](#legacy-negative-lookahead)

With `routes`, you use [PCRE Regex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl_Compatible_Regular_Expressions) negative lookahead. The following example proxies all requests to the `/maintenance` page except for `/maintenance` itself to avoid infinite loop:

vercel.json

```
{
  "$schema": "https://openapi.vercel.sh/vercel.json",
  "routes": [{ "src": "/(?!maintenance)", "dest": "/maintenance" }]
}
```

With [`rewrites`](/docs/project-configuration#rewrites), the Regex needs to be wrapped. The following example is equivalent to the legacy `routes` usage above, but instead uses `rewrites`:

vercel.json

```
{
  "$schema": "https://openapi.vercel.sh/vercel.json",
  "rewrites": [
    { "source": "/((?!maintenance).*)", "destination": "/maintenance" }
  ]
}
```

#### [Legacy Case Sensitivity](#legacy-case-sensitivity)

With `routes`, the `src` property is case-insensitive leading to duplicate content, where multiple request paths with difference cases serve the same page.

With [`rewrites`](/docs/project-configuration#rewrites) / [`redirects`](/docs/project-configuration#redirects) / [`headers`](/docs/project-configuration#headers), the `source` property is case-sensitive so you don't accidentally create duplicate content.

# Git Configuration

Copy page

Ask AI about this page

Last updated March 4, 2025

The following configuration options can be used through a `vercel.json` file like the [Project Configuration](/docs/project-configuration).

## [git.deploymentEnabled](#git.deploymentenabled)

Type: `Object` of key branch identifier `String` and value `Boolean`, or `Boolean`.

Default: `true`

Specify branches that should not trigger a deployment upon commits. By default, any unspecified branch is set to `true`.

vercel.json

```
{
  "$schema": "https://openapi.vercel.sh/vercel.json",
  "git": {
    "deploymentEnabled": {
      "dev": false
    }
  }
}
```

### [Matching multiple branches](#matching-multiple-branches)

Use [minimatch syntax](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch) to define behavior for multiple branches.

The example below prevents automated deployments for any branch that starts with `internal-`.

vercel.json

```
{
  "$schema": "https://openapi.vercel.sh/vercel.json",
  "git": {
    "deploymentEnabled": {
      "internal-*": false
    }
  }
}
```

### [Branches matching multiple rules](#branches-matching-multiple-rules)

If a branch matches multiple rules and at least one rule is `true`, a deployment will occur.

vercel.json

```
{
  "$schema": "https://openapi.vercel.sh/vercel.json",
  "git": {
    "deploymentEnabled": {
      "experiment-*": false,
      "*-dev": true
    }
  }
}
```

A branch named `experiment-my-branch-dev` will create a deployment.

### [Turning off all automatic deployments](#turning-off-all-automatic-deployments)

To turn off automatic deployments for all branches, set the property value to `false`.

vercel.json

```
{
  "$schema": "https://openapi.vercel.sh/vercel.json",
  "git": {
    "deploymentEnabled": false
  }
}
```

## [github.autoAlias](#github.autoalias)

Type: `Boolean`.

When set to `false`, [Vercel for GitHub](/docs/git/vercel-for-github) will create preview deployments upon merge.

Follow the [deploying a staged production build](/docs/deployments/promoting-a-deployment#staging-and-promoting-a-production-deployment) workflow instead of this setting.

vercel.json

```
{
  "$schema": "https://openapi.vercel.sh/vercel.json",
  "github": {
    "autoAlias": false
  }
}
```

## [github.autoJobCancelation](#github.autojobcancelation)

Type: `Boolean`.

When set to false, [Vercel for GitHub](/docs/git/vercel-for-github) will always build pushes in sequence without cancelling a build for the most recent commit.

vercel.json

```
{
  "$schema": "https://openapi.vercel.sh/vercel.json",
  "github": {
    "autoJobCancelation": false
  }
}
```

## [Legacy](#legacy)

### [github.silent](#github.silent)

The `github.silent` property has been deprecated in favor of the new settings in the dashboard, which allow for more fine-grained control over which comments appear on your connected Git repositories. These settings can be found in [the Git section of your project's settings](/docs/git/vercel-for-github#silence-github-comments).

Type: `Boolean`.

When set to `true`, [Vercel for GitHub](/docs/git/vercel-for-github) will stop commenting on pull requests and commits.

vercel.json

```
{
  "$schema": "https://openapi.vercel.sh/vercel.json",
  "github": {
    "silent": true
  }
}
```

### [github.enabled](#github.enabled)

The `github.enabled` property has been deprecated in favor of [git.deploymentEnabled](/docs/project-configuration/git-configuration#git.deploymentenabled), which allows you to disable auto-deployments for your project.

Type: `Boolean`.

When set to `false`, [Vercel for GitHub](/docs/git/vercel-for-github) will not deploy the given project regardless of the GitHub app being installed.

vercel.json

```
{
  "$schema": "https://openapi.vercel.sh/vercel.json",
  "github": {
    "enabled": false
  }
}

Once you have [connected a Git repository](/docs/git#deploying-a-git-repository), select the Git menu item from your project settings page to edit your project’s Git settings. These settings include:

*   Managing Git Large File Storage (LFS)
*   Creating Deploy Hooks
*   Ignoring the build step when a commit is pushed to the Git repository

## [Disconnect your Git repository](#disconnect-your-git-repository)

To disconnect your Git repository from your Vercel project:

1.  Choose a project from the [dashboard](/dashboard)
2.  Select the Settings tab and then select the Git menu item
3.  Under Connected Git Repository, select the Disconnect button.

## [Git Large File Storage (LFS)](#git-large-file-storage-lfs)

If you have [LFS objects](https://git-lfs.com/) in your repository, you can enable or disable support for them from the [project settings](/docs/projects/project-dashboard#settings). When support is enabled, Vercel will pull the LFS objects that are used in your repository.

You must [redeploy your project](/docs/deployments/managing-deployments#redeploy-a-project) after turning Git LFS on.

## [Deploy Hooks](#deploy-hooks)

Vercel supports deploy hooks, which are unique URLs that accept HTTP POST requests and trigger deployments. Check out [our Deploy Hooks documentation](/docs/deploy-hooks) to learn more.

## [Ignored Build Step](#ignored-build-step)

By default, Vercel creates a new [deployment](/docs/deployments) and build (unless the Build Step is [skipped](/docs/deployments/configure-a-build#skip-build-step)) for every commit pushed to your connected Git repository.

Each commit in Git is assigned a unique hash value commonly referred to as SHA. If the SHA of the commit was already deployed in the past, no new Deployment is created. In that case, the last Deployment matching that SHA is returned instead.

To ignore the build step:

1.  Choose a project from the [dashboard](/dashboard)
2.  Select the Settings tab and then select the Git menu item
3.  In the Ignored Build Step section, select the behavior you would like. This behavior provides a command that outputs a code, which tells Vercel whether to issue a new build or not. The command is executed within the [Root Directory](/docs/deployments/configure-a-build#root-directory) and can access all [System Environment Variables](/docs/environment-variables/system-environment-variables):
    *   Automatic: Each commit will issue a new build
    *   Only build production: When the `VERCEL_ENV` is production, a new build will be issued
    *   Only build preview: When the `VERCEL_ENV` is preview, a new build will be issued
    *   Only build if there are changes: A new build will be issued only when the Git diff contains changes
    *   Only build if there are changes in a folder: A new build will be issued only when the Git diff contains changes in a folder that you specify
    *   Don't build anything: A new build will never be issued
    *   Run my Bash script: [Run a Bash script](/guides/how-do-i-use-the-ignored-build-step-field-on-vercel) from a location that you specify
    *   Run my Node script: [Run a Node script](/guides/how-do-i-use-the-ignored-build-step-field-on-vercel) from a location that you specify
    *   Custom: You can enter any other command here, for example, only building an Nx app ([`npx nx-ignore <project-name>`](https://github.com/nrwl/nx-labs/tree/main/packages/nx-ignore#usage))
4.  When your deployment enters the `BUILDING` state, the command you've entered in the Ignored Build Step section will be run. The command will always exit with either code `1` or `0`:
    *   If the command exits with code `1`, the build continues as normal
    *   If the command exits with code `0`, the build is immediately aborted, and the deployment state is set to `CANCELED`

Canceled builds are counted as full deployments as they execute a build command in the build step. This means that any canceled builds initiated using the ignore build step will still count towards your [deployment quotas](/docs/limits#deployments-per-day-hobby) and [concurrent build slots](/docs/deployments/concurrent-builds).

You may be able to optimize your deployment queue by [skipping builds](/docs/monorepos#skipping-unaffected-projects) for projects within a monorepo that are unaffected by a change.

To learn about more advanced usage see the ["How do I use the Ignored Build Step field on Vercel?"](/guides/how-do-i-use-the-ignored-build-step-field-on-vercel) guide.

### [Ignore Build Step on redeploy](#ignore-build-step-on-redeploy)

If you have set an ignore build step command or [script](/guides/how-do-i-use-the-ignored-build-step-field-on-vercel), you can also skip the build step when redeploying your app:

1.  From the Vercel dashboard, select your project
2.  Select the Deployments tab and find your deployment
3.  Click the ellipses (...) and from the context menu, select Redeploy
4.  Uncheck the Use project's Ignore Build Step checkbox

# Global Vercel CLI Configuration

Copy page

Ask AI about this page

Last updated September 24, 2025

Using the following files and configuration options, you can configure [Vercel CLI](/cli) under your system user.

The two global configuration files are: `config.json` and `auth.json`. These files are stored in the `com.vercel.cli` directory inside [`XDG_DATA_HOME`](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html), which defaults to:

*   Linux: `~/.local/share/com.vercel.cli`
*   macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/com.vercel.cli`
*   Windows: `%APPDATA%\Roaming\xdg.data\com.vercel.cli`

These files are automatically generated by Vercel CLI, and shouldn't need to be altered.

## [config.json](#config.json)

This file is used for global configuration of Vercel deployments. Vercel CLI uses this file as a way to co-ordinate how deployments should be treated, consistently.

The first option is a single `_` that gives a description to the file, if a user should find themselves looking through it without context.

You can use the following options to configure all Vercel deployments on your system's user profile:

### [currentTeam](#currentteam)

Type: `String`.

Valid values: A [team ID](/docs/accounts#find-your-team-id).

This option tells [Vercel CLI](/cli) which context is currently active. If this property exists and contains a team ID, that team is used as the scope for deployments, otherwise if this property does not exist, the user's Hobby team is used.

config.json

```
{
  "currentTeam": "team_ofwUZockJlL53hINUGCc1ONW"
}
```

### [collectMetrics](#collectmetrics)

Type: `Boolean`.

Valid values: `true` (default), `false`.

This option defines whether [Vercel CLI](/cli) should collect anonymous metrics about which commands are invoked the most, how long they take to run, and which errors customers are running into.

config.json

```
{
  "collectMetrics": true
}
```

## [auth.json](#auth.json)

This file should not be edited manually. It exists to contain the authentication information for the Vercel clients.

In the case that you are uploading your global configuration setup to a potentially insecure destination, we highly recommend ensuring that this file will not be uploaded, as it allows an attacker to gain access to your provider accounts.

Last updated September 5, 2025

From the Vercel [dashboard](/dashboard), there are two areas where you can configure settings:

*   Team Settings: Any settings configured here, are applied at the team-level, although you can select which project's the settings should be set for.
*   Project Settings: These are specific settings, accessed through the [project dashboard](/docs/projects/project-dashboard), that are only scoped to the selected project. You can make changes about all areas relating to your project, including domains, functions, drains, integrations, Git, caching, environment variables, deployment protection, and security.

This guide focuses on the project settings. To edit project settings:

1.  Ensure you have selected your Team from the [scope selector](/docs/dashboard-features#scope-selector).
2.  Choose a project from the [dashboard](/dashboard).
3.  Select the Settings tab.
4.  Find the settings you need and make changes.

## [Configuring your project with a vercel.json file](#configuring-your-project-with-a-vercel.json-file)

While many settings can be set from the dashboard, you can also define a `vercel.json` file at the project root that allows you to set and override the default behavior of your project.

To learn more, see [Configuring projects with vercel.json](/docs/project-configuration).

## [General settings](#general-settings)

This provides all the foundational information and settings for your Vercel project, including the name, build and deployment settings, the directory where your code is located, the Node.js version, Project ID, toolbar settings, and more.

To learn more, see [General Settings](/docs/project-configuration/general-settings)

## [Build and deployment settings](#build-and-deployment-settings)

In your build and deployment settings, adjust configurations such as framework settings, code directory, and Node.js version.

In this section, you can adjust build-related configurations, such as framework settings, code directory, Node.js version, and more.

To learn more, see [Configuring Functions](/docs/functions/configuring-functions).

## [Cron Jobs](#cron-jobs)

You can enable and disable Cron Jobs for your project from the Project Settings. Configuring cron jobs is done in your codebase.

To learn more, see [Cron Jobs](/docs/cron-jobs).

## [Project members](#project-members)

Team owners can manage who has access to the project by adding or removing members to that specific project from the project settings.

To learn more, see [project-level roles](/docs/rbac/access-roles/project-level-roles).

## [Webhooks](#webhooks)

Webhooks allow your external services to respond to events in your project. You can enable them on a per-project level from the project settings.

To learn more, see the [Webhooks documentation](/docs/webhooks).

## [Drains](#drains)

Drains are a Pro and Enterprise feature that allow you to send observability data (logs, traces, speed insights, and analytics) to external services. Drains are created at the team-level, but you can manage them on a per-project level from the project settings.

To learn more, see the [Drains documentation](/docs/drains/using-drains).

## [Security settings](#security-settings)

From your project's security settings you can enable or disable [Attack Challenge Mode](/docs/attack-challenge-mode), [Logs and Source Protection](/docs/projects/overview#logs-and-source-protection), [Customer Success Code Visibility](/docs/projects/overview#customer-success-code-visibility) [Git Fork Protection](/docs/projects/overview#git-fork-protection), and set a [retention policy for your deployments](/docs/security/deployment-retention).

To learn more, see [Security Settings](/docs/project-configuration/security-settings).

## [Advanced](#advanced)

Vercel provides some additional features in order to configure your project in a more advanced way. This includes:

*   Displaying [directory listing](/docs/directory-listing)
*   Enabling [Skew protection](/docs/skew-protection)

# Security settings

Copy page

Ask AI about this page

Last updated October 2, 2025

To adjust your project's security settings:

1.  Select your project from your [dashboard](/dashboard)
2.  Select the Settings tab
3.  Choose the Security menu item

From here you can enable or disable [Attack Challenge Mode](/docs/attack-challenge-mode), [Logs and Source Protection](#build-logs-and-source-protection), [Customer Success Code Visibility](#customer-success-code-visibility) and [Git Fork Protection](#git-fork-protection).

## [Build logs and source protection](#build-logs-and-source-protection)

By default, the following paths mentioned below can only be accessed by you and authenticated members of your Vercel team:

*   `/_src`: Displays the source code and build output.
*   `/_logs`: Displays the build logs.

Disabling Build Logs and Source Protection will make your source code and logs publicly accessible. Do not edit this setting if you don't want them to be publicly accessible.  

  

None of your existing deployments will be affected when you toggle this setting. If you’d like to make the source code or logs private on your existing deployments, the only option is to delete these deployments.

This setting is overwritten when a deployment is created using Vercel CLI with the [`--public` option](/docs/cli/deploy#public) or the [`public` property](/docs/project-configuration#public) is used in `vercel.json`.

For deployments created before July 9th, 2020 at 7:05 AM (UTC), only the Project Settings is considered for determining whether the deployment's Logs and Source are publicly accessible or not. It doesn't matter if the `--public` flag was passed when creating those Deployments.

## [Customer Success Code Visibility](#customer-success-code-visibility)

Customer Success Code Visibility is available on [Enterprise](/docs/plans/enterprise) and [Pro](/docs/plans/pro) plans

Vercel provides a setting that controls the visibility of your source code to our Customer Success team. By default, this setting is disabled, ensuring that your code remains confidential and accessible only to you and your team. The Customer Success team might request for this setting to be enabled to troubleshoot specific issues related to your code.

## [Git fork protection](#git-fork-protection)

If you receive a pull request from a fork of your repository, Vercel will require authorization from you or a [Team Member](/docs/rbac/managing-team-members) to deploy the pull request.

This behavior protects you from leaking sensitive project information such as environment variables and the [OIDC Token](/docs/oidc).

You can disable this protection in the Security section of your Project Settings.

Do not disable this setting until you review Environment Variables in your project as well as `vercel.json` in your source code.

## [Secure Backend Access with OIDC Federation](#secure-backend-access-with-oidc-federation)

This feature allows you to secure access to your backend services by using short-lived, non-persistent tokens that are signed by Vercel's OIDC Identity Provider (IdP).

To learn more, see [Secure Backend Access with OIDC Federation](/docs/oidc).

## [Deployment Retention Policy](#deployment-retention-policy)

Deployment Retention Policy allows you to set a limit on how long older deployments are kept for your project. To learn more, see [Deployment Retention Policy](/docs/security/deployment-retention).

This section also provides information on the recently deleted deployments

Last updated March 12, 2025

Projects on Vercel represent applications that you have deployed to the platform from a [single Git repository](/docs/git). Each project can have multiple deployments: a single production deployment and many pre-production deployments. A project groups [deployments](/docs/deployments) and [custom domains](/docs/domains/add-a-domain).

While each project is only connected to a single, imported Git repository, you can have multiple projects connected to a single Git repository that includes many directories, which is particularly useful for [monorepo](/docs/monorepos) setups.

You can view all projects in your team's [Vercel dashboard](/dashboard) and selecting a project will bring you to the [project dashboard](/docs/projects/project-dashboard), where you can:

*   View an overview of the [production deployment](/docs/deployments) and any active pre-production deployments.
*   Configure [project settings](/docs/project-configuration/project-settings) such as setting [custom domains](/docs/domains), [environment variables](/docs/environment-variables), [deployment protection](/docs/security/deployment-protection), and more.
*   View details about each [deployment](/docs/deployments) for that project, such as the status, the commit that triggered the deployment, the deployment URL, and more.
*   Manage [observability](/docs/observability) for that project, including [Web Analytics](/docs/analytics), [Speed Insights](/docs/speed-insights), and [Logs](/docs/observability/logs).
*   Managing the project's [firewall](/docs/vercel-firewall).

      rootDirectory: '<root-directory>',
    },
  });
 
  // Handle the result
  console.log(result);
}
 
run();
```

## [Pausing a project](#pausing-a-project)

You can choose to temporarily pause a project to ensure that you do not incur usage from [metered resources](/docs/limits#additional-resources) on your production deployment.

### [Pausing a project when you reach your spend amount](#pausing-a-project-when-you-reach-your-spend-amount)

To automatically pause your projects when you reach your spend amount:

1.  On the Vercel [dashboard](/dashboard), ensure you have selected the correct team from the [scope selector](/docs/dashboard-features#scope-selector).
2.  Select the Settings tab.
3.  In the Spend Management section, select the Pause all production deployments option. Then follow the steps to confirm the action.

To learn more, see the [Spend Management documentation](/docs/spend-management#pausing-projects).

### [Pause a project using the REST API](#pause-a-project-using-the-rest-api)

To pause a project manually or with a webhook you can use the [REST API](/docs/rest-api/reference/endpoints/projects/pause-a-project):

1.  Ensure you have [access token](/docs/rest-api#creating-an-access-token) scoped to your team to authenticate the API.
2.  Create a webhook that calls the pause project [endpoint](/docs/rest-api/reference/endpoints/projects/pause-a-project):
    *   You'll need to pass a path parameter of the [Project ID](/docs/projects/overview#project-id) and query string of [Team ID](/docs/accounts#find-your-team-id):
        
        request
        
        ```
        https://api.vercel.com/v1/projects/<prj_ID>/pause?teamId=<team_ID>
        ```
        
    *   Use your access token as the bearer token, to enable you to carry out actions through the API on behalf of your team.
    *   Ensure that your `Content-Type` header is set to `application/json`.

When you pause your project, any users accessing your production deployment will see a [503 DEPLOYMENT\_PAUSED error](/docs/errors/DEPLOYMENT_PAUSED).

cURL

```
curl --request POST \
  --url "https://api.vercel.com/v1/projects/<project-id>/pause?teamId=<team-id>&slug=<team-slug>" \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer $VERCEL_TOKEN"
```

You can also manually make a POST request to the [pause project endpoint](/docs/rest-api/reference/endpoints/projects/pause-a-project) without using webhook.

### [Resuming a project](#resuming-a-project)

Resuming a project can either be done through the [REST API](/docs/rest-api/reference/endpoints/projects/unpause-a-project) or your project settings:

1.  Go to your team's [dashboard](/dashboard) and select your project. When you select it, you should notice it has a paused icon in the scope selector.
2.  Select the Settings tab.
3.  You'll be presented with a banner notifying you that your project is paused and your production deployment is unavailable.
4.  Select the Resume Service button.
5.  In the dialog that appears, confirm that you want to resume service of your project's production deployment by selecting the Resume button.

Your production deployment will resume service within a few minutes. You do not need to redeploy it.

## [Deleting a project](#deleting-a-project)

Deleting your project will also delete the deployments, domains, environment variables, and settings within it. If you have any deployments that are assigned to a custom domain and do not want them to be removed, make sure to deploy and assign them to the custom domain under a different project first.

To delete a project:

1.  On the Vercel [dashboard](/dashboard), ensure you have selected the correct team from the [scope selector](/docs/dashboard-features#scope-selector) and select the project you want to delete.
2.  Select the Settings tab.
3.  At the bottom of the General page, you’ll see the Delete Project section. Click the Delete button.
    
    ![The Delete Project section.](/vc-ap-vercel-docs/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F7nyt0uhk7sse4zvn.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs-assets%2Fstatic%2Fdocs%2Fconcepts%2Fprojects%2Fdelete-project-light.png&w=1920&q=75)![The Delete Project section.](/vc-ap-vercel-docs/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F7nyt0uhk7sse4zvn.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs-assets%2Fstatic%2Fdocs%2Fconcepts%2Fprojects%2Fdelete-project-dark.png&w=1920&q=75)

Ask AI about this page

Last updated September 24, 2025

Each Vercel project has a separate dashboard to configure settings, view deployments, and more.

To get started with a project on Vercel, see [Creating a Project](/docs/projects/managing-projects#creating-a-project) or [create a new project with one of our templates](/new/templates).

## [Project overview](#project-overview)

![](/vc-ap-vercel-docs/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F7nyt0uhk7sse4zvn.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs-assets%2Fstatic%2Fdocs%2Fconcepts%2Fprojects%2Fproject-dashboard%2Fproject-tab-light.png&w=3840&q=75)![](/vc-ap-vercel-docs/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F7nyt0uhk7sse4zvn.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs-assets%2Fstatic%2Fdocs%2Fconcepts%2Fprojects%2Fproject-dashboard%2Fproject-tab-dark.png&w=3840&q=75)

The Project tab.

The Project Overview tab provides an overview of your production deployment, including its [active Git branches](#active-branches), [build logs](/docs/deployments/logs), [runtime logs](/docs/runtime-logs), [associated domains](/docs/domains), and more.

### [Active branches](#active-branches)

![](/vc-ap-vercel-docs/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F7nyt0uhk7sse4zvn.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs-assets%2Fstatic%2Fdocs%2Fconcepts%2Fprojects%2Fproject-dashboard%2Factive-branches-light.png&w=1920&q=75)![](/vc-ap-vercel-docs/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F7nyt0uhk7sse4zvn.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs-assets%2Fstatic%2Fdocs%2Fconcepts%2Fprojects%2Fproject-dashboard%2Factive-branches-dark.png&w=1920&q=75)

The Active Branches section of the Project Overview tab.

The Project Overview's Active Branches gives you a quick view of your project's branches that are being actively committed to. The metadata we surface on these active branches further enables you to determine whether there's feedback to resolve or a deployment that needs your immediate attention.

If your project isn't connected to [a Git provider](/docs/git), you'll see a Preview Deployments section where Active Branches should be.

You can filter the list of active branches by a search term, and see the status of each branch's deployment at a glance with the colored circle icon to the left of the branch name.

From the Active Branches section, you can:

*   View the status of a branch's deployment
*   Redeploy a branch, if you have [the appropriate permissions](/docs/rbac/access-roles/team-level-roles)
*   View build and runtime logs for a branch's deployment
*   View a branch's source in your chosen Git provider
*   Copy a branch's deployment URL for sharing and viewing amongst members of your team. To share the preview with members outside of your team, see [our docs on sharing preview URLs](/docs/deployments/environments#preview-environment-pre-production#sharing-previews).

## [Deployments](#deployments)

![](/vc-ap-vercel-docs/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F7nyt0uhk7sse4zvn.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs-assets%2Fstatic%2Fdocs%2Fconcepts%2Fprojects%2Fproject-dashboard%2Fdeployments-light.png&w=1920&q=75)![](/vc-ap-vercel-docs/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F7nyt0uhk7sse4zvn.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs-assets%2Fstatic%2Fdocs%2Fconcepts%2Fprojects%2Fproject-dashboard%2Fdeployments-dark.png&w=1920&q=75)

The Deployments tab.

The project dashboard lets you manage all your current and previous deployments associated with your project. To manage a deployment, select the project in the dashboard and click the Deployments tab from the top navigation.

You can sort your deployments by branch, or by status. You can also interact with your deployment by redeploying it, inspecting it, assigning it a domain, and more.

See [our docs on managing deployments](/docs/deployments/managing-deployments) to learn more.

## [Web Analytics and Speed Insights](#web-analytics-and-speed-insights)

![A snapshot of the Speed Insights tab from the project view.](/vc-ap-vercel-docs/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F7nyt0uhk7sse4zvn.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs-assets%2Fstatic%2Fdocs%2Fconcepts%2Fspeed-insights%2Fres-chart-light.png&w=3840&q=75)![A snapshot of the Speed Insights tab from the project view.](/vc-ap-vercel-docs/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F7nyt0uhk7sse4zvn.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs-assets%2Fstatic%2Fdocs%2Fconcepts%2Fspeed-insights%2Fres-chart-dark.png&w=3840&q=75)

A snapshot of the Speed Insights tab from the project view.

You can learn about your site's performance metrics with [Speed Insights](/docs/speed-insights). When enabled, this dashboard displays in-depth information about scores and individual metrics without the need for code modifications or leaving the Vercel dashboard.

Through [Web Analytics](/docs/analytics), Vercel exposes data about your audience, such as the top pages, top referrers, and visitor demographics.

## [Runtime logs](#runtime-logs)

![Layout to visualize the runtime logs.](/vc-ap-vercel-docs/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F7nyt0uhk7sse4zvn.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs-assets%2Fstatic%2Fdocs%2Fconcepts%2Fdeployments%2Flogs%2Fruntime-logs-ui-light.png&w=3840&q=75)![Layout to visualize the runtime logs.](/vc-ap-vercel-docs/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F7nyt0uhk7sse4zvn.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs-assets%2Fstatic%2Fdocs%2Fconcepts%2Fdeployments%2Flogs%2Fruntime-logs-ui-dark.png&w=3840&q=75)

Layout to visualize the runtime logs.

The Logs tab inside your project dashboard allows you to view, search, inspect, and share your runtime logs without any third-party integration. You can filter and group your runtime logs based on the relevant [fields](/docs/runtime-logs#log-filters).

# Transferring a project

Copy page

Ask AI about this page

Last updated September 24, 2025

You can transfer projects between your Vercel teams with zero downtime and no workflow interruptions.

You must be an [owner](/docs/rbac/access-roles#owner-role) of the team you're transferring from, and a member of the team you're transferring to. For example, you can transfer a project from your Hobby team to a Pro team, and vice versa if you're an owner on the Pro team.

During the transfer, all of the project's dependencies will be moved or copied over to the new Vercel team namespace. To learn more about what is transferred, see the [What is transferred?](#what-is-transferred) and [What is not transferred?](#what-is-not-transferred).

## [Starting a transfer](#starting-a-transfer)

1.  To begin transferring a project, choose a project from the Vercel [dashboard](/dashboard).
2.  Then, select the Settings tab from the top menu to go to the project settings.
3.  From the left sidebar, click General and scroll down to the bottom of the page, where you'll see the Transfer Project section. Click Transfer to begin the transferring flow:
    
    ![The Transfer Project section.](/vc-ap-vercel-docs/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F7nyt0uhk7sse4zvn.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs-assets%2Fstatic%2Fdocs%2Fconcepts%2Fprojects%2Ftransfer-project-light.png&w=1920&q=75)![The Transfer Project section.](/vc-ap-vercel-docs/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F7nyt0uhk7sse4zvn.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs-assets%2Fstatic%2Fdocs%2Fconcepts%2Fprojects%2Ftransfer-project-dark.png&w=1920&q=75)
    
    The Transfer Project section.
    
4.  Select the Vercel team you wish to transfer the project to. You can also choose to create a new team:
    
    ![Choosing a team to transfer the project to.](/vc-ap-vercel-docs/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F7nyt0uhk7sse4zvn.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs-assets%2Fstatic%2Fdocs%2Fconcepts%2Fprojects%2Ftransfer-project-model-light.png&w=1080&q=75)![Choosing a team to transfer the project to.](/vc-ap-vercel-docs/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F7nyt0uhk7sse4zvn.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs-assets%2Fstatic%2Fdocs%2Fconcepts%2Fprojects%2Ftransfer-project-model-dark.png&w=1080&q=75)
    
    Choosing a team to transfer the project to.
    
    If the target Vercel team does not have a valid payment method, you must add one before transferring your project to avoid any interruption in service.
5.  You'll see a list of any domains, aliases, and environment variables that will be transferred. You can also choose a new name for your project. By default, the existing name is re-used. You must provide a new name if the target Vercel team already has a project with the same name:
    
    The original project **will be hidden** when initiating the transfer, but you will not experience any downtime.
    
    ![Reviewing the project data that will be transferred to the target Vercel team, and choosing a new project name.](/vc-ap-vercel-docs/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F7nyt0uhk7sse4zvn.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs-assets%2Fstatic%2Fdocs%2Fconcepts%2Fprojects%2Fproject-transfer-confirm-light.png&w=1080&q=75)![Reviewing the project data that will be transferred to the target Vercel team, and choosing a new project name.](/vc-ap-vercel-docs/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F7nyt0uhk7sse4zvn.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs-assets%2Fstatic%2Fdocs%2Fconcepts%2Fprojects%2Fproject-transfer-confirm-dark.png&w=1080&q=75)
    
    Reviewing the project data that will be transferred to the target Vercel team, and choosing a new project name.
    
6.  After reviewing the information, click Transfer to initiate the project transfer.
7.  While the transfer is in progress, Vercel will redirect you to the newly created project on the target Vercel team with in-progress indicators. When a transfer is in progress, you may not create new deployments, edit project settings or delete that project.

Transferring a project may take between 10 seconds and 10 minutes, depending on the amount of associated data. When the transfer completes, the transfer's initiator and the target team's owners are notified by email. You can now use your project as normal.

## [What is transferred?](#what-is-transferred)

*   [Deployments](/docs/deployments)
*   [Environment variables](/docs/environment-variables) are copied to the target team, except for those defined in the [`env`](/docs/project-configuration#env) and [`build.env`](/docs/configuration#project/build-env) configurations of `vercel.json`.
*   The project's configuration details
*   [Domains and Aliases](#transferring-domains)
*   Administrators
*   Project name
*   Builds
*   Git repository link
*   Security settings
*   [Cron Jobs](/docs/cron-jobs)
*   [Preview Comments](/docs/comments)
*   [Web Analytics](/docs/analytics)
*   [Speed Insights](/docs/speed-insights)
*   [Function Region](/docs/regions#compute-defaults)
*   [Directory listing setting](/docs/directory-listing)

Once you transfer a project from a Hobby team to a Pro or Enterprise team, you may choose to enable additional paid features on the target team to match the features of the origin team. These include:

*   [Concurrent Builds](/docs/deployments/concurrent-builds)
*   [Preview Deployment Suffix](/docs/deployments/generated-urls#preview-deployment-suffix)
*   [Password Protection](/docs/deployments/deployment-protection#password-protection)

## [What is not transferred?](#what-is-not-transferred)

*   [Integrations](/docs/integrations): Those associated with your project must be added again after the transfer is complete
*   [Edge Configs](/docs/edge-config) have [a separate transfer mechanism](/docs/storage#transferring-your-store)
*   Usage is reset on transfer
*   The Active Branches section under Project will be empty
*   Environment variables defined in the [`env`](/docs/project-configuration#env) and [`build.env`](/docs/configuration#project/build-env) configurations of `vercel.json` must be [migrated to Environment Variables](/guides/how-do-i-migrate-away-from-vercel-json-env-and-build-env) in the Project Settings or configured again on the target team after the transfer is complete
*   [Monitoring](/docs/observability/monitoring) data is not transferred
*   Log data ([Runtime](/docs/runtime-logs) + [build](/docs/deployments/logs) time)
*   [Custom Log Drains](/docs/drains) are not transferred
*   [Vercel Blob](/docs/storage/vercel-blob) has [a separate transfer mechanism](/docs/storage#transferring-your-store)

## [Transferring domains](#transferring-domains)

Project [domains](/docs/domains) will automatically be transferred to the target team by delegating access to domains.

For example, if your project uses the domain `example.com`, the domain will be [moved](/docs/projects/custom-domains#moving-domains) to the target team. The target team will be billed as the primary owner of the domain if it was purchased through Vercel.

If your project uses the domain `blog.example.com`, the domain `blog.example.com` will be delegated to the target team, but the root domain `example.com` will remain on the origin Vercel scope. The origin Vercel scope will remain the primary owner of the domain, and will be billed as usual if the domain was purchased through Vercel.

If your project uses a [Wildcard domain](/docs/domains/working-with-domains#wildcard-domain) like `*.example.com`, the Wildcard domain will be delegated to the target team, but the root domain `example.com` will remain on the origin Vercel scope.

## [Additional features](#additional-features)

This only applies when transferring away from a team.

When transferring between teams, you may be asked whether you want to add additional features to the target team to match the origin team's features. This ensures an uninterrupted workflow and a consistent experience between teams. Adding these features is optional.

# Query

Copy page

Ask AI about this page

Last updated October 7, 2025

Query is available on [Enterprise](/docs/plans/enterprise) and [Pro](/docs/plans/pro) plans

You can use Query to get deeper visibility into your application when debugging issues, monitoring usage, or optimizing for speed and reliability. Query lets you explore traffic, errors, latency and similar metrics in order to:

*   Investigate errors, slow routes, and high-latency functions
*   Analyze traffic patterns and request volumes by path, region, or device
*   Monitor usage and performance of AI models or API endpoints
*   Track build and deployment behavior across your projects
*   Save queries to notebooks for reuse and team collaboration
*   Customize dashboards and automate reporting or alerts

## [Getting started](#getting-started)

To start using Query, you first need to [enable Observability Plus](#enable-observability-plus). Then, you can [create a new query](#create-a-new-query) based on the metrics you want to analyze.

### [Enable Observability Plus](#enable-observability-plus)

Enabling and disabling Observability Plus are available on [Enterprise](/docs/plans/enterprise) and [Pro](/docs/plans/pro) plans

Those with the [owner](/docs/rbac/access-roles#owner-role) role can access this feature

*   Pro and Enterprise teams should [Upgrade to Observability Plus](/docs/observability#enabling-observability-plus) to edit queries in modal.
*   Free observability users can still open a query, but they cannot modify any filters or create new queries.

[Enterprise](/docs/plans/enterprise) teams can [contact sales](/contact/sales) to get a customized plan based on their requirements.

### [Create a new query](#create-a-new-query)

1.  ### [Access the Observability dashboard](#access-the-observability-dashboard)
    
    *   At the Team level: Go to the [Vercel dashboard](/dashboard) and click the Observability tab
    *   At the Project level: Go to the [Vercel dashboard](/dashboard), select the project you would like to monitor from the scope selector, and click the Observability tab
2.  ### [Initiate a new query](#initiate-a-new-query)
    
    *   Start a new query: In the Observability section, click the button (New Query) to open the query creation interface.
    *   Select a data source: Under "Visualize", select the [metric](/docs/observability/query/query-reference#metric) you want to analyze such as edge requests, serverless function invocations, external API requests, or other events.
3.  ### [Define query parameters](#define-query-parameters)
    
    *   Select the data aggregation: Select how you would like the values of your selected metric to be compiled such as sum, percentage, or per second.
    *   Set Time Range: Select the time frame for the data you want to query. This can be a predefined range like "Last 24 hours" or a custom range.
    *   Filter Data: Apply filters to narrow down the data. You can filter by a list of [fields](/docs/query/reference#group-by-and-where-fields) such as project, path, WAF rule, edge region, etc.
4.  ### [Visualize Query](#visualize-query)
    
    *   View the results: The graph below the filter updates automatically as you change the filters.
    *   Adjust as Needed: Refine your query parameters if needed to get precise insights.
5.  ### [Save and Share Query](#save-and-share-query)
    
    *   Save the query: Once you are satisfied with your query, you can save it by clicking Add to Notebook.
    *   Select a notebook: Select an existing [notebook](/docs/notebooks) from the dropdown.
    *   Share Query: You can share the saved query from the notebook with team members by clicking on the Share with team button.

## [Using Query](#using-query)

*   When building queries, you can select the most appropriate view, and visualize results with:
    *   a line or a volume chart
    *   a table, if your query has a group by clause
    *   a big number (with a time series), if your query has no group by clause
*   You can [save your queries](#save-and-share-query) in [notebooks](/docs/notebooks) either for personal use or to share with your team.
*   In the dashboard, you can [create a new query](#create-a-new-query) using the query [form fields](/docs/query/reference#group-by-and-where-fields) or the AI assistant at top of the new query form.

## [Manage IP Address visibility for Query](#manage-ip-address-visibility-for-query)

Managing IP Address visibility is available on [Enterprise](/docs/plans/enterprise) and [Pro](/docs/plans/pro) plans

Those with the [owner, admin](/docs/rbac/access-roles#owner, admin-role) role can access this feature

Vercel creates events each time a request is made to your website. These events include unique parameters such as execution time and bandwidth used.

Certain events such as `public_ip` may be considered personal information under certain data protection laws. To hide IP addresses from your query:

1.  Go to the Vercel [dashboard](/dashboard) and ensure your team is selected in the scope selector.
2.  Go to the Settings tab and navigate to Security & Privacy.
3.  Under IP Address Visibility, toggle the switch next to "Off" so the text reads IP addresses are currently hidden in the Vercel Dashboard..

For business purposes, such as DDoS mitigation, Vercel will still collect IP addresses.

## [More resources](#more-resources)

*   Learn about available metrics and aggregations and how you can group and filter the data in [Query Reference](/docs/observability/query/query-reference).

Ask AI about this page

Last updated September 24, 2025

Monitoring will be [sunset](/docs/query/monitoring#monitoring-sunset) for Pro plans at the end of your next billing cycle in November 2025. To continue using full query abilities, consider migrating to [Observability Query](/docs/observability/query), which is included with [Observability Plus](/docs/observability/observability-plus).

Monitoring allows you to visualize and quantify the performance and traffic of your projects on Vercel. You can use [example queries](/docs/observability/monitoring/monitoring-reference#example-queries) or create [custom queries](/docs/observability/monitoring/quickstart#create-a-new-query) to debug and optimize bandwidth, errors, performance, and bot traffic issues in a production or preview deployment.

1.  Go to Monitoring tab from the dashboard
2.  Click Get Observability Plus and you see a confirmation modal
3.  Click Continue and then Confirm and pay to get access to both Observability Plus and Monitoring

Enabling and disabling Observability Plus are available on [Pro plans](/docs/plans/pro)

Those with the [owner](/docs/rbac/access-roles#owner-role) role can access this feature

[Enterprise](/docs/plans/enterprise) teams can [contact sales](/contact/sales) to get a customized plan based on their requirements.

## [Disable Monitoring](#disable-monitoring)

1.  Go to your team Settings > Billing
2.  Scroll to the Observability Plus section
3.  Set the toggle to the disabled state

## [Manage IP Address visibility for Monitoring](#manage-ip-address-visibility-for-monitoring)

Managing IP Address visibility is available on [Enterprise](/docs/plans/enterprise) and [Pro](/docs/plans/pro) plans

Those with the [owner, admin](/docs/rbac/access-roles#owner, admin-role) role can access this feature

Vercel creates events each time a request is made to your website. These events include unique parameters such as execution time and bandwidth used.

Certain events such as `public_ip` may be considered personal information under certain data protection laws. To hide IP addresses from your Monitoring queries:

1.  Go to the Vercel [dashboard](/dashboard) and ensure your team is selected in the scope selector.
2.  Go to the Settings tab and navigate to Security & Privacy.
3.  Under IP Address Visibility, toggle the switch next to off so the text reads IP addresses are hidden in your Monitoring queries..

For business purposes, such as DDoS mitigation, Vercel will still collect IP addresses.

For a complete list of fields, see the [visualize clause](/docs/observability/monitoring/monitoring-reference#visualize) docs.

## [Monitoring sunset](#monitoring-sunset)

From the end of billing cycle in Nov 2025, Vercel will sunset Monitoring for pro plans. Pro users will no longer see the Monitoring tab. Current enterprise users with monitoring access will keep the deprecated version of monitoring. If you want to continue using the full Monitoring capabilities or purchase a product similar to Monitoring, consider moving to [Query](/docs/observability/query).

*   Enable [Observability Plus](/docs/observability/observability-plus) to continue using query features.
*   Save queries in Observability [Notebooks](/docs/observability/query#save-query).

Last updated June 23, 2025

Monitoring will be [sunset](/docs/query/monitoring#monitoring-sunset) for Pro plans at the end of your next billing cycle in November 2025. To continue using full query abilities, consider migrating to [Observability Query](/docs/observability/query), which is included with [Observability Plus](/docs/observability/observability-plus).

## [Pricing](#pricing)

Monitoring has become part of Observability, and is therefore included with Observability Plus at no additional cost. If you are currently paying for Monitoring, you should [migrate](/docs/observability#enabling-observability-plus) to Observability Plus to get access to additional product features with a longer retention period for the same base fee.

Even if you choose not to migrate to Observability Plus, Vercel will automatically move you to the new pricing modal of $1.20 per 1 million events, as shown below. If you do not migrate to Observability Plus, you will not be able to access Observability Plus features on the Observability tab.

Monitoring will be [sunset](/docs/query/monitoring#monitoring-sunset) for Pro plans at the end of your next billing cycle in November 2025. To continue using full query abilities, consider migrating to [Observability Query](/docs/observability/query), which is included with [Observability Plus](/docs/observability/observability-plus).

## [Visualize](#visualize)

The `Visualize` clause selects what query data is displayed. You can select one of the following fields at a time, [aggregating](#aggregations) each field in one of several ways:

| Field Name | Description | Aggregations |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Edge Requests | The number of [Edge Requests](/docs/manage-cdn-usage#edge-requests) | Count, Count per Second, Percentages |
| Duration | The time spent serving a request, as measured by Vercel's CDN | Sum, Sum per Second, Min/Max, Percentages, Percentiles |
| Incoming Fast Data Transfer | The amount of [Fast Data Transfer](/docs/manage-cdn-usage#fast-data-transfer) used by the request. | Sum, Sum per Second, Min/Max, Percentages, Percentiles |
| Outgoing Fast Data Transfer | The amount of [Fast Data Transfer](/docs/manage-cdn-usage#fast-data-transfer) used by the response. | Sum, Sum per Second, Min/Max, Percentages, Percentiles |
| Function Duration | The amount of \[Vercel Function duration\](/docs/ |  |
| fluid-compute#pricing-and-usage), as measured in GB-hours. | Sum, Sum per Second, Min/Max, Percentages, Percentiles |  |
| Function Invocations | The number of [Vercel Function invocations](/docs/functions/usage-and-pricing#managing-function-invocations) | Count, Count per Second, Percentages |
| Function Duration | The amount of [Vercel Function duration](/docs/functions/usage-and-pricing#managing-function-duration), as measured in GB-hours. | Sum, Sum per Second, Min/Max, Percentages, Percentiles |
| Function CPU Time | The amount of CPU time a Vercel Function has spent responding to requests, as measured in milliseconds. | Sum, Sum per Second, Min/Max, Percentages, Percentiles |
| Incoming Fast Origin Transfer | The amount of [Fast Origin Transfer](/docs/manage-cdn-usage#fast-origin-transfer) used by the request. | Sum, Sum per Second, Min/Max, Percentages, Percentiles |
| Outgoing Fast Origin Transfer | The amount of [Fast Origin Transfer](/docs/manage-cdn-usage#fast-origin-transfer) used by the response. | Sum, Sum per Second, Min/Max, Percentages, Percentiles |
| Provisioned Memory | The amount of memory provisioned to a Vercel Function. | Sum, Sum per Second, Min/Max, Percentages, Percentiles |
| Peak Memory | The maximum amount of memory used by Vercel Function at any point in time. | Sum, Sum per Second, Min/Max, Percentages, Percentiles |
| Requests Blocked | All requests blocked by either the system or user. | Count, Count per Second, Percentages |
| Incoming Legacy Bandwidth | Legacy Bandwidth sent from the client to Vercel | Sum, Sum per Second, Min/Max, Percentages, Percentiles |
| Outgoing Legacy Bandwidth | Legacy Bandwidth sent from Vercel to the client | Sum, Sum per Second, Min/Max, Percentages, Percentiles |
| Total Legacy Bandwidth | Sum of Incoming and Outgoing Legacy Bandwidth | Sum, Sum per Second, Min/Max, Percentages, Percentiles |

### [Aggregations](#aggregations)

The visualize field can be aggregated in the following ways:

| Aggregation | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Count | The number of requests that occurred |
| Count per Second | The average rate of requests that occurred |
| Sum | The sum of the field value across all requests |
| Sum per Second | The sum of the field value as a rate per second |
| Minimum | The smallest observed field value |
| Maximum | The largest observed field value |
| Percentiles (75th, 90th, 95th, 99th) | Percentiles for the field values. For example, 90% of requests will have a duration that is less than the 90th percentile of duration. |
| Percentages | Each group is reported as a percentage of the ungrouped whole. For example, if a query for request groups by hosts, one host may have 10% of the total request count. Anything excluded by the `where` clause is not counted towards the ungrouped whole. |

Aggregations are calculated within each point on the chart (hourly, daily, etc depending on the selected granularity) and also across the entire query window

## [Where](#where)

The `Where` clause defines the conditions to filter your query data. It only fetches data that meets a specified condition based on several [fields](/docs/query/monitoring/monitoring-reference#group-by-and-where-fields) and operators:

| Operator | Description |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `=` | The operator that allows you to specify a single value |  |
| `in` | The operator that allows you to specify multiple values. For example, `host in ('vercel.com', 'nextjs.com')` |  |
| `and` | The operator that displays a query result if all the filter conditions are `TRUE` |  |
| `or` | The operator that displays a query result if at least one of the filter conditions are `TRUE` |  |
| `not` | The operator that displays a query result if the filter condition(s) is `NOT TRUE` |  |
| `like` | The operator used to search a specified pattern. This is case-sensitive. For example, `host like 'acme.com'`. You can also use `_` to match any single character and `%` to match any substrings. For example, `host like 'acme_.com'` will match with `acme1.com`, `acme2.com`, and `acme3.com`. `host like 'acme%'` will also have the same matches. To do a case-insensitive search, use `ilike` |  |
| `startsWith` | Filter data values that begin with some specific characters |  |
| `match` | The operator used to search for patterns based on a regular expression ([`Re2`](https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax) syntax). For example, `match(user_agent, 'Chrome/97.*')` |  |

String literals must be surrounded by single quotes. For example, `host = 'vercel.com'`.

## [Group by](#group-by)

The `Group By` clause calculates statistics for each combination of [field](#group-by-and-where-fields) values. Each group is displayed as a separate color in the chart view, and has a separate row in the table view.

For example, grouping by `host` and `status` will display data broken down by each combination of `host` and `status`.

## [Limit](#limit)

The `Limit` clause defines the maximum number of results displayed. If the number of query results is greater than the `Limit` value, then the remaining results are compiled as Other(s).

## [Group by and where fields](#group-by-and-where-fields)

There are several fields available for use within the [where](#where) and [group by](#group-by) clauses:

| Field Name | Description |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `host` | Group by the request's domains and subdomains |  |
| `path_type` | Group by the request's [resource type](#path-types) |  |
| `project_id` | Group by the request's project ID |  |
| `status` | Group by the request's HTTP response code |  |
| `source_path` | The mapped path used by the request. For example, if you have a dynamic route like `/blog/[slug]` and a blog post is `/blog/my-blog-post`, the `source_path` is `/blog/[slug]` |  |
| `request_path` | The path used by the request. For example, if you have a dynamic route like `/blog/[slug]` and a blog post is `/blog/my-blog-post`, the `request_path` is `/blog/my-blog-post` |  |
| `cache` | The [cache](/docs/edge-cache#x-vercel-cache) status for the request |  |
| `error_details` | Group by the [errors](/docs/errors) that were thrown on Vercel |  |
| `deployment_id` | Group by the request's deployment ID |  |
| `environment` | Group by the environment (`production` or [`preview`](/docs/deployments/environments#preview-environment-pre-production)) |  |
| `request_method` | Group by the HTTP request method (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, etc.) |  |
| `http_referer` | Group by the HTTP referer |  |
| `public_ip` | Group by the request's IP address |  |
| `user_agent` | Group by the request's user agent |  |
| `asn` | The autonomous system number (ASN) for the request. This is related to what network the request came from (either a home network or a cloud provider) |  |
| `bot_name` | Group by the request's bot crawler name. This field will contain the name of a known crawler (e.g. Google, Bing) |  |
| `region` | Group by the [region](/docs/regions) the request was routed to |  |
| `waf_action` | Group by the WAF action taken by the [Vercel Firewall](/docs/security/vercel-waf) (`deny`, `challenge`, `rate_limit`, `bypass` or `log`) |  |
| `action` | Group by the action taken by [Vercel DDoS Mitigations](/docs/security/ddos-mitigation) (`deny` or `challenge`) |  |
| `skew_protection` | When `active`, the request would have been subject to [version skew](/docs/deployments/skew-protection) but was protected. When `inactive`, the request did not require skew protection to be fulfilled. |  |

### [Path types](#path-types)

All your project's resources like pages, functions, and images have a path type:

| Path Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `static` | A static asset (`.js`, `.css`, `.png`, etc.) |
| `func` | A [Vercel Function](/docs/functions) |
| `external` | A resource that is outside of Vercel. This is usually caused when you have [rewrite rules](/docs/project-configuration#rewrites) |
| `edge` | A [Vercel Function](/docs/functions) using [Edge runtime](/docs/functions/runtimes/edge) |
| `prerender` | A pre-rendered page built using [Incremental Static Regeneration](/docs/incremental-static-regeneration) |
| `streaming_func` | A [streaming Vercel Function](/docs/functions/streaming-functions) |
| `background_func` | The [Incremental Static Regeneration Render Function](/docs/incremental-static-regeneration) used to create or update a static page |

## [Chart view](#chart-view)

![Monitoring options including Data Granularity of day or hour](/vc-ap-vercel-docs/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F7nyt0uhk7sse4zvn.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs-assets%2Fstatic%2Fdocs%2Fmonitoring%2Fmonitoring-top-bar-light.png&w=1920&q=75)![Monitoring options including Data Granularity of day or hour](/vc-ap-vercel-docs/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F7nyt0uhk7sse4zvn.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs-assets%2Fstatic%2Fdocs%2Fmonitoring%2Fmonitoring-top-bar-dark.png&w=1920&q=75)

Monitoring options including Data Granularity of day or hour

In the chart view (vertical bar or line), `Limit` is applied at the level of each day or hour (based the value of the Data Granularity dropdown). When you hover over each step of the horizontal axis, you can see a list of the results returned and associated colors.

## [Table view](#table-view)

In the table view (below the chart), `Limit` is applied to the sum of requests for the selected query window so that the number of rows in the table does not exceed the value of `Limit`.

## [Example queries](#example-queries)

On the left navigation bar, you will find a list of example queries to get started:

| Query Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Requests by Hostname | The total number of requests for each `host` |
| Requests Per Second by Hostname | The total number of requests per second for each `host` |
